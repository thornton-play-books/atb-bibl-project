Most single-Book psalms are very low ranked (all are outside the top 20 overall and top 6 by book), but a handful scrape into the top 8 by Book, eg psalm 89 in Book 1 is ranked 8 (6 mentions) and psalm 47 in Book 2 ranked 7. Cases like these could be worth a closer look in context to see if there’s anything interesting about them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA slightly different view of popularity: only the psalms that are referenced in all four books, but not otherwise constrained, so we get a few that didn’t appear in the first heatmap because their average ranking is fairly low. Nonetheless, the fact of making it into all four Books might be of interest."

    "text": "Categories\nI don’t know if there are any categorisation schemes you would use - we may need to talk about this.\nI’m trying out a couple of things here: the division into five books in the Psalter; and what seems to be a commonly used classification scheme by Hermann Gunkel. I’ve seen others, but I don’t know what’s actually useful for our purposes.\nSo these are just test runs; I can easily enough repeat and extend analysis with any classification scheme.\n\nGunkel categories\nSome Psalms are in more than one Gunkel category; to simplify things for the moment, I pick just one (at random).\nThe categories aren’t evenly distributed in the psalms overall, which needs to be taken into account.\nComparing psalms ATB used at least once with the overall frequency (ie, counting each Psalm only once) there are slight differences, but they aren’t significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, counting individual references shows a much clearer (and statistically significant) expansion of the Thanksgiving category and reduced Liturgy compared to the reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pattern is even more marked when analysis is restricted to the Psalms with at least 10 references in atb; the Hymn group is also somewhat bigger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top Psalms again with their categories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsalter Book groups\nTurning to the Psalter book groups, which are also not evenly distributed (list pulled from wikipedia):\n\nBook 1 - Psalms 1–41\nBook 2 - Psalms 42–72\nBook 3 - Psalms 73–89\nBook 4 - Psalms 90–106\nBook 5 - Psalms 107–150\n\n(I’ll use the label “Group” rather than “Book” to avoid confusion with AT Books.)\npsalm distribution in ATB is almost identical to the groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthis time, counting individual references makes very little difference (which I find actually quite odd!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd again for 10+ references, slightly pro group 5 and against group 2 but minor differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop psalms again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomparison of Books\nIn the gunkel categories, Book 2 looks a bit different from the others; I’d say the variations between the other three Books aren’t significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Psalter groups, Book 2 is a bit different again; Book 3 looks a bit different too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll leave this here and can follow up once we’ve had a chance to discuss possible categorisation schemes."

But very short divs can be a bit problematic with that kind of method, so divs of less than 100 words are highlighted (triangles instead of round lollipops).\nThe short labels I’m using (especially for Book 3) are rough and ready work in progress but hopefully give enough info to make sense: there’s another table below to help locate them. (Numbers in brackets are used to make repeated labels unique.)\nIt’s no great surprise that quotes tend to be most concentrated in divs that are explicitly labelled as prayers, meditations, etc. So what gets more interesting is when other divs make it into the top 30 or so. In the case of Book 1 the first of these is a very short div; the first substantial div is AT’s traumatic illness at Oswaldkirk (I need to fix the spelling in the label) in ?1661.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivs devoted to prayer and meditation form a much smaller proportion of Book Rem, so they’re accordingly less common here.
