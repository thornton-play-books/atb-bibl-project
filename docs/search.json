    "text": "Divs\nThe Books’ &lt;div&gt; tagging can be used give some more meaningful insights, but because divs in the Books vary a lot in length, they’re trickier to use. I’m using word counts and calculating quote word count as a percentage of div word count. But very short divs can be a bit problematic with that kind of method, so divs of less than 100 words are highlighted (triangles instead of round lollipops).\nThe short labels I’m using (especially for Book 3) are rough and ready work in progress but hopefully give enough info to make sense: there’s another table below to help locate them. (Numbers in brackets are used to make repeated labels unique.)\nIt’s no great surprise that quotes tend to be most concentrated in divs that are explicitly labelled as prayers, meditations, etc. So what gets more interesting is when other divs make it into the top 30 or so. In the case of Book 1 the first of these is a very short div; the first substantial div is AT’s traumatic illness at Oswaldkirk (I need to fix the spelling in the label) in ?1661.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivs devoted to prayer and meditation form a much smaller proportion of Book Rem, so they’re accordingly less common here. But densities are quite low even in the top ranked divs. I think “illness after mother’s death” may be the same as illness at Oswaldkirk in Book 1!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think this is less effective for Book 2 and especially Book 3 because the divs tend to be long and contain more mixed material than 1/Rem. It’s difficult to give some divs meaningful labels. This is likely to need some more thought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable\nColumns are filterable and sortable.

Using these totals, overall quotations average out to 7.6% of the total word count.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent narratives are much less likely to contain quotations than the Books as a whole. Only about a quarter of events (aggregating any mentions throughout all the Books) contain any quotations at all (79 events of 319), and quotes only make up 2.1% of the total word count for events.\nNB: “event” refers to the 319 events that we created metadata for (excluding groups); “event mention” refers to the individual tagged instances of those events in texts.\nThe breakdown by Book is interesting: 1 and Rem are still well ahead, but 2 and 3 have swapped places."

The most striking thing about that is that the third-largest keyword (legal/financial) contains very few biblical quotes.
