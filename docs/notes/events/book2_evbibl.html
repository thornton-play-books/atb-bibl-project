A weary pilgrimage,Whose glory in one day doth fill the stageWith childhood, manhood and decrepit age.<a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.2&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 2</a>And what's a life?

A blast sustained with clothing,Maintain'd with food, retain'd with vile self-loathing,Then weary of itself, again'd to nothing.Read on this dial, how the shades devourMy short-lived winter's-day; hour eats up hour,Alas, the total's but from ten to four.Behold these lilies (which thy hands have madeFair copies of my life, and open laidTo view): how soon they droop, how soon they fade!Shade not that dial, night will blind too soon,My nonage day already points to noon.How simple is my suit? How small my boon!Nor do I beg this slender inch to whileThe time away, or falsely to beguileMy thoughts with joy: here's nothing worth a smile.No, no: 'tis not to please no wanton earsWith feigned mirth; I beg but hours, not years,And what thou giv'st me, I will give to tears.Draw not that soul which would be rather led;That seed has yet not broke my serpent's head.Oh, shall I die before my sins are dead?Behold these rags: am I a fitting guestTo taste the dainties of thy royal feast,With hands and face unwashed, ungirt, unblessed?First, let the Jordan streams (that find suppliesFrom the deep fountain of my heart) arise,And cleanse my spots, and clear my watery eyes:I have a world of sins to be lamented;I have a sea of tears that must be vented;Oh, spare 'til then, and then I die contented.</p>

          This I speak not to boast nor glory of anything in
            this world save in the cross of my Christ, which has
            loved me and given himself for me that I might

            For no sooner was the tragedy of my honour acted —
            the relation of which is in my 'First Book' related,
            with several happy circumstances in order to my
            vindication upon my first knowledge by what
            means I came into that sad misfortune — but 
            divine providence so ordered also 
            <span class="event" id="ev1-start">
            
            that all the
            parties (which was accused by Mrs Danby and her
            accursed instrument, Barbara Todd) which was
            in my house was brought before my brother
            Denton and examined of what they were charged withal.
            And all, with a full consent, did utterly deny anything of that nature. And, upon their oaths, did
            vindicate their wronged mistress from those 
            abuses with great indignation against the first
            authors of that wickedness.</span>
          
         
    <span class="event" id="ev1a-start">
          And then, Barbara did fly to accuse one maid
            which was gone away to be the raiser of those slanders,
            which woman was written to by Daphne to know the
            truth of such reports. 
         But the said woman did utterly deny that she
            did ever know or see any evil by me in all her
            life and did admire at their impudence which should
            raise any such scandal against her mistress and herself.</span>

    <span class="event" id="ev1b-start">
          I had likewise the great comfort of several
            dear friends which came to see me and stayed some 
            time until the extremity of my passion of grief
            was mitigated (by which I was almost killed).
            These, I thank God, was so fortunate as to
            return much satisfied of the goodness of God,
            who would not suffer me to lie too long under
            the <span class="evquote">scourge of the tongues</span> of malicious persons
            but, even in the midst of this misery, gave me
            some relief (lest that by the multitude of <span class="evquote">sorrows
            my life should be swallowed up</span>).</span>
          
         By the assistance of these friends did I receive
            the benefit of the resurrection of my <span class="quote">good name</span>
            (which seemed to be eclipsed by the false calumnies at
            a distance) where I had been traduced: even my 
            very enemies themselves <span class="quote">had their mouths 
            stopped</span>. God being pleased that their consciences
            did accuse them and many of them did, with tears,
            acknowledge their sin in believing or hearing of
            lies against me (contrary to their own knowledge)
            and begged upon their knees for Christ's sake to
            pardon their wickedness: for they knew I was 
            innocent. These, to whom God had given the
            grace to repent, I prayed the Lord to forgive them,

            though they had done a very great wickedness
            and sinned against God and my innocent soul.
            But I knew that the same God which can raise my
            body from the grave will, for his own glory, also give
            a resurrection to my <span class="quote">good name</span>, which yet was not
            touched nor blemished by any of my own deserts.
            Though Satan had raised up these storms to cast
            me into despair which, I hope, he never should 
            prevail against me in, nor make me cast away integrity, nor my hope in my dear saviour
            who was <span class="quote">traduced himself by the Jews</span>.
          From this sad dispensation of these slanders —
            and that my gracious God had done mercifully to
             vindicate my cause, and grant me some comfort
            beginning to restore my health and strength —
            
            
            it pleased the divine wisdom to deprive me of
            the comfort of my dear husband's life,
            bringing me into another sad dispensation
             which I had much rather (to have had my choice)
            have been deprived of my own, who was weary
            of the world and myself.
            
            
    <span class="event" id="ev2-start">
         Even then did the Lord take from me the joy of
            my heart and the delight of my eyes; adding one

            poor, dejected heart was drenched into a deep

            Often had I petitioned heaven to spare him
            and to call me to himself when I have seen him
            in his palsy fits.
         
            But my dear would reprove me, and say that I
            offended God in too much loving him and not
            to be willing to part with him, wishing that we might
            all be freed out of this miserable world and enjoy
            God forever. 
          Yet, since it is the will of God thus to part
             us for a while, oh, that my desires and joys may
            be entirely separate from the enjoyments here,
            which are vain and unsatisfactory and disquieting,
            and that I may only take delight in heaven
            and what may tend that way in myself, 
            
            and 
             in the safe conduct of my poor children  and this
            family. As I have been eminently under the
             afflicting hand of God by trials, crosses and 
            troubles, both spiritual and temporals, 
         so I may bring forth the <span class="quote">fruits of the spirit</span> 
            more abundantly to the glory of God forever.

            Forasmuch it hath pleased our gracious Father

            by the grievous sickness of the palsy — which had been
            upon his person for three years in many fits and
            great relapses, having had all the means used
            for his preservation which did always cure him
            until now — he was determined by this sickness to
            free his body from sickness, and his precious soul
            from troubles and sorrows of this life and to give
            him a glorious immortality in a better world.</span>

            delight on earth, and so suddenly to be deprived
            of him when I expected my own death each
            moment (even then, when he took his leave
            of me, when he went to Malton).
            
            
            How could this so sudden, and so unexpected , a change and terrible affliction but surprise
               my weakened spirits — already depressed by
               sickness and griefs and sorrows caused by the late
               slanders upon my innocency and virtue —

            Such was my fainting, dying spirits that

            My faintings and weaknesses was so great and
            returned so strongly upon me — all that night and
            for two days after — that dear friends and
            children did not expect but when I should have
            departed (having lost so much blood in the
            flood that broke upon me, by excess of grief, 
            at the first knowing of my slanderous accusation
            by Mrs Anne Danby and her maid, Barbara Todd).

            reduced to great extremity and none hoped for my
            life a long time and  — but for the great and charitable
            kindness of my friends which comforted me and
            prayed with me and for me in that most sad and
            desperate condition — I had utterly fainted
            and my soul had departed in that languishing
            condition (having now the heavy wrath of 
            my God, joined to the malice of my enemies,
            who had taken from me my greatest earthly 
            comfort away; leaving a desolate and helpless
            widow and my three dear children orphans,

            desiring his body to be decently interred, and
            with as much circumstances of mournings
            to friends and other expenses concerning that
            sad occasion as the estate could allow.
            Nay, indeed, more than the law would
            allow, where an estate was so much charged
            with debts, besides the maintenance of all my
               three children (then but young).</span>
            
         
            But, if it were an error in me, it was of the right
            hand: out of my love to him, and the honour I
            bore to his memory. And, therefore, was very
            willing to bear that burden upon myself
            and estate rather than see that last act of
            kindness to my dear husband done to the
            lessening of the reputation of that family I so
            much loved and esteemed, and according to its
            worth and antiquity.
         
            I confess to have suffered some reproach
            from some who taxed me with too great expenses on that occasion. But I acted not alone
            in it, without the advice of my best friends,
            who ordered things with prudence and discretion
             and as necessity did require.

            After the death and burial of my dear husband,

            and to receive and pay debts) in regard

            that Mr Thornton had not made any will
            how he would have things done in his estate.
            
            Which thing I had very often put him in
            mind to do, in regard of his sad fits of the palsy
            which might seize suddenly on him and deprive
            him of the satisfaction of leaving things done
            according to his mind. 
            To which, he said that he had made a deed
            of settlement for his children's maintenance
            and for portions for his two daughters,
               as also for the payment of his debts, and
               for his son, Robert, he knew I would take
               care of him and that he doubted not of that but he
               would want for nothing</span> which I could do.
            In regard that his estate was much charged
            already with debts which would and must be paid,
         
            I told 
            him that I knew debts ought to be paid
            but knew not what was owing by him. But
            to that end, to enable him to pay and for
            his satisfaction, I was willing to forgo
            my £1000 out of Ireland. And to
            show my faithful affection to him and his
            family to do good to them all,
            I waived my own interest in that part of
            my portion which was  settled on me and my heirs.
            And also, by reason that the debts took up so 
            great a part of the estate out of Leysthorpe that

         there could not be sufficient to discharge what
            was upon it and to maintain and educate my
               son, Robert, I was freely willing — of my own 
            choice — to show my entire love to himself and my
               son and two daughters to take that upon 
            myself. And to give him what allowance I was
            able out of what my own estate would allow
            (considering my present circumstances which was
            but low) if all the debts could not be otherwise
            paid and satisfied, and God forbid they should 
            not be paid which was justly proved.
         And I hoped he would think it fit (and 
            but just) that I should have a competent
            maintenance, who had brought so considerable a fortune to the estate and to him.
         
            Also, he knew that my £1000 out of
            Ireland was stated and settled by articles and bond
            before marriage to be laid out in land for the
            longer liver of us two and the heirs of our bodies.
            And that Leysthorpe was entailed upon my heirs
            male by the said articles of marriage (as may
            appear) which would have fallen upon his son, Robert,
            after his decease — as was intended by us — without charge.
            There was also provision by a deed of settlement
            and for maintenance, education and portions for
            the younger children out of Burn Park before
            marriage, which

         by his unfortunate engagement in that affair
               of the assignment of Maulger Norton (Date: August 2nd, 1658) of the
            resignation of the Irish estate of my father
               to pay debts and portions and legacies 
            which, alas, my husband was persuaded
            to undertake by the advice of his uncle
               Richard Darley (and that so he might, having that
               estate in his own hand,  satisfy himself first of what was due to myself and
               my mother's arrears due to her from thence).
            But this was done by my husband, indeed,
            without my dear mother's consent or knowledge
            of my own, and we both did before that desire
            and entreat him never to do it. For all our
            interests was sufficiently secured by my
               dear and honoured father's will and deeds, and we
            might have been paid our dues in the first
               if we had demanded it legally
               (whereas, the taking upon him the assignment
               of the whole trust did involve him in the charge
            and made him liable to be sued by the creditors).
         
         
            My dear heart told me this was all 
            
               
               true
            
            and he confessed it — with a great grief to him —
            that he did not take our advice, but on the
            contrary took his two uncles' and wished to God

            he had not done it. But now it was too late, and
            he had repented it 100 times;
            </span> 
            
          <span class="event" id="ev9-start">for it was 
            that which reduced him into these straits, and
            that he was forced to give Mr Nettleton 
            bond and judgement for his debt. And entered into a statute,
         
         whereupon Nettleton sued him to an 
            outlawry and prosecuted my dear husband
            with so great malice until he compelled him to
            take that course which he was very sorry to do;
            that was, to sell the estate at Burn Park
            (which was settled for his younger children's provision) and to pay, with £1000 of that money, Mr
                  Nettleton, which otherwise would have cast him
            into prison. (That estate being sold for £2000.)

            <span class="event" id="ev10-start">
            As for the other part of the money, being £1000,
            I desired Mr Thornton he would be pleased
            to pay with it his two brothers (Thomas and John)
            and his two sisters (Elizabeth and Frances) their
            portions with it: for I could not endure to see
            their portions unpaid which was due to be done —
            by his own engagement — when they cut
            off the entail to enable him to make settlement
            of marriage for himself (without which he could
            not expect a fortune with a wife).
            But Mr Thornton said he would not do that,
               for he could purchase a rentcharge with it (of
               £80 per annum)

               great advantage to him, and pay his brothers
            and sisters interest out of that.
            I was neither convinced nor satisfied
            with that way, but rather desired the other,
            because that debt had been sooner satisfied
            and his estate more clear and their portions paid.
         
            But Mr Thornton took his way with it and
            it proved to be worse, and that rentcharge
            was afterwards sold to Mr Danby to pay
               debts.

            Now, since I am so far in discourse
            of this business, it will concern me to say
            something concerning the cutting off that
            estate from my children, which not only did
            unsettle that part of Burn Park but did break
            the whole settlement of the rest and did
            reduce the estate into a very ill condition.

               and, for default of issue male by me, then to the
               females of our bodies, as may appear in the articles

               Hipswell, dated July 2nd, 1651. Upon which was
               the deed of settlement for jointure (for me
               and all other provision for our issue) and the entail
            of East Newton and Leysthorpe to be done in that
            manner, as was agreed by my dear mother and
               my husband (without which she would not consent
            to the marriage, which covenants is at large 
               expressed, and more at large and may appear by
               the said articles which are in my custody).

            The sad consequence of this engagement
            to Mr Norton, about that assignment, made Mr
            Thornton liable to pay my father's debts, which
            was appointed by his will to be done out of that 
            estate in Ireland  (according to justice in him)
            to take care for them, as well as for his three younger
            children's maintenance

            trust reposed in him by my honoured father's last
            will and testament, being an executor.)
            But, to be quit of that trouble, very politically did
            persuade my uncles (Richard and Francis Darley
            , who came over to Hipswell at that time) to advise
            my husband to undertake that trust and to free
            my uncle Norton of that trouble, and give Mr Thornton,

         as they thought, a better advantage to get
            his dues (being in my behalf, and for my dear
               mother's, the greatest creditor).
            But, alas, it proved otherwise to him and that
               we feared; for, he (being a meek, peaceable man
               and did not love this trouble of managing of
            his own) could not be able to grapple with such
            spirits as he had to contend with all in that trust.
             And though he was not obliged to secure Mr
            Nettleton's debt (nor any else) of my father's out
            of his own estate, neither by law nor equity, 
            yet, not discerning some persons' drift to be
            secured their own debt by Mr Thornton out of his own
               estate, persuaded him to do it — first, to Nettleton,
            and next to give security to themselves, which
            proved a great snare and gave them opportunity
               to seek satisfaction from him — and did not look
               at the estate out of which the debts ought to be paid
            and which Mr Thornton could not get money out
               of so fast as was demanded by creditors.
            
            
         
         What, for the charge of solicitors and journeys into Ireland and high returns, took up much
               of that money was received there, and so his
               own went to make it up. </span> <span class="event" id="ev12a-start">Together with great

             many hundreds from the estate of Castlecomer,
            yet never satisfied those moneys. But let my
            dear mother be sued by Edmunds many years
             after. And got himself freed and left her in the lurch
            to the mercy of that Jew, who sued her to an outlawry and put her to great grief (who was

            my dear mother had about that business).
          Although, when he had proved the will and had
            taken administration, he came to my mother

            grace of God, he would perform that sacred
             and just will of that holy, good man (my Lord
               Deputy Wandesford) to his utmost ability.
          
         
        
          But after this, he
            
               
               
             went with his family
            to Castlecomer and there lived like a lord on the
            land, and received rents and did what he would amongst the
             tenants, but paid nobody nor debts, but 
            cast them upon my dear mother which had all the hard
            trouble of children, servants, debts, et cetera, while
             she lived in Ireland to her great damage and loss,
           and was ready to do all acts of kindness to the
            family and for the honour of my father's memory.
             She stayed in Dublin until after the rebellion broke
             out in October 23rd following, paid off servants and bills
            and creditors, due before his death;

            with my two nephews (Tom and Kitt Danby) came
            to England, stayed at Chester no longer than
            we could get safely into Yorkshire, we passed
            many dangers and enemies, but our God delivered
            us out of them</span> all: blessed be his holy name forever.
       
          
    <span class="event" id="ev24-start">
         
            At Chester,
            
               
               at that time,
            
            my dear mother was 
            desired by my uncle (William Wandesford) to
            give him my father's 'Book of Advice' to his
               son, George, writ with his own hand
            which he would
            keep for my brother, George. She made many 
            excuses and would not willingly have given it
            him, but done it herself, as most proper for her.
            But at last, she found him discontented and was
            willing to oblige his kindness to herself and
            children. She committed it into his care and custody,
            with charge to preserve it (as the richest jewel she
            had) to be continued in the family and given to her
               son, George, on the first opportunity which he did protest faithfully he would . But, alas, it was afterwards in the wars lost (as he said) with all his writings.

            But the suddenness 
            and
             surprise my uncle William took
            her in did prevent her intentions of taking
            a copy of my dear father's Book before he
            got it from her, and she was but newly come into
            England (and but a stranger) wanted time to take
            a copy; therefore, desired to let her have a copy
            of it from him which he did promise her.
          Though the wars, growing hot betwixt the king
             and parliament, caused my uncle to fly for
            safety and leave the said book into the custody
             of some friends — with his own evidences of all
             his estate which the parliament party seized on — 
             yet, blessed be God, I have great cause to
            acknowledge his great goodness in the preserving one copy of the said book (which now
             I am so happy to enjoy one writ out by it).
          
            And although the manuscript
             itself was
            so unhappily gone from the whole family,
            and that none of his children was so happy
            to see our dear and blessed father, his advice,
            under his own hand (writing to his dear
               son, George) but myself who read it several
            times over when in my mother's keeping.
          
         
            The benefit whereof I would 
            not have wanted
            for great riches, when I had his advice to us by his
            own pen, and esteemed it a great mercy to me in
            particular whose counsel was most piercing to my 
        [heart]

            and when I could bear witness myself that
            his advice to his children was zealously practised
            by himself in his life and holy conversation.
         
            And
             it has been my great grief that no 
            good friend's pen could have leisure in those
            sad times to write us an account to the world of
            his eminent, holy, wise, prudent and pious life and
            conversation, whose virtues was so eminent that
            he lives fresh in the memories of all that knew
            him; if it had been writ out, it would continue
            his memory forever.
         
          We must, therefore, rest ourselves contented in
             the enjoyment of what he left behind him and —
            since we are deprived of the original of that
             excellent manuscript itself —</span> <span class="event" id="evn1-start">be thankful for
            what we have of him in the copy which I obtained

          Praising the Lord, my God, who brought to my
            memory fresh again so much of that good 
               Book which, although I had not seen nor heard
             of, for many years (videlicet, from the year 1641
               until the year 1657, or 1664),
          yet did those characters remain so deeply 
            engraven on my poor heart that I could have
            testified the truth to have been my honoured father's
            method, style and counsel. And have got it copied
            over since I had it for my brother, Sir Christopher Wandesford, 
            his son and for the Earl of Strafford who desired them very earnestly of me.</span>

            Upon the agreement and compromise of all
            the suits in the family when the will was awanting, and after it was found again
            to our joy and comfort and all belonging (who had
            an interest in it) made by Baron Thorpe,
            and all things settled betwixt Mr Thornton
            and Sir Christopher Wandesford — and he ordered to deliver up the
            Irish estate on trust to perform the will —
         they were to meet with Mr John Dodsworth
            of Watlass who was, as a common friend, entrusted to keep some writings for all parties.
         Mr Thornton and my brother Denton
            was to go thither in order to sign and seal
            writings with Sir Christopher Wandesford, who had yielded
            to pay my £1000 out of Ireland
            and to satisfy Mr Thornton for Mr Nettleton's
            debt (for which he suffered so much and was so
            much perplexed by him).

            
    <span class="event" id="ev25-start">
               I say, when my husband was then at
               Watlass (my cousin Dodsworth, carrying him into
            his study to look upon his books, having a very
            fine library there)
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.45&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 45</a>





         
            my cousin Dodsworth told him, 'Cousin,
            I have one little book in my study which is but
            a little manuscript (a paper book, a copy)
         but I value it above all the books in my
            library. And that is my Lord Deputy 
               Wandesford's  'Book of Advice' to his son, George'.
         
            Upon which, my dear husband said that he
            had heard much of it, and a very high character
               of it but never had seen it. And that his wife
               had many times (with tears) lamented the 
               loss of it extremely and would be overjoyed
               to have but a copy of it; asking my cousin how
            he had it and came by it because the original
               was lost many years ago (as I told him).
         My cousin told him the truth of it. That it
            was, indeed, writ out in Ireland by his son,
            Timothy Dodsworth, who was my lord deputy's
            servant, and one whom my lord had a peculiar
            kindness for (intending to make him his secretary).
            And, when my lord had come home from the
            council table, did every night for an hour or two
            write in that book before he went to bed.
            And, after that he was in bed, made him read in
            some good book and instructed him in it, and so continued
            until my lord was overcome with sleep (he not going
            to bed until twelve or one o'clock at night and rise again
            by five or six in the mornings).

            My lord leaving the book on the table
            at his going to bed, his son, Timothy, knew
            something of the subject (that it was of an
            excellent nature, as this that came from him)
            thought it would be of great advantage
               to himself in point of instruction (being a
               young man and but coming into the world).
            And so, without my lord's knowledge, did
            copy it over himself, as well as he could by
               nights, when my lord was asleep and so he
            sat many nights up the most of it to do
               it; for he durst not have done it if my lord
            had discovered him.
            'I confess', said my cousin, 'it was a very bold
            part in him to do it — and what he ought not —
            but since it so fell out that the original
            of my lord's book was lost, I think it was
            very well that we had something of him,
            though it be not so perfectly writ as by day one
            might correct the mistakes that n'er
              
             a scholar
               where it is not true spelled'.
         
            Mr Thornton begged the book of him for
            me, and said he would correct anything of that
            kind, and did assure him I would take it for
            the highest favour he could do me and it would be

            the greatest kindness in the world; so he lent
            it him for me to have a month to read and take
            a copy of, which by great kindness I got my good
               brother Denton to do for me. (He, writing it in
            characters, could not for his other employ get
            done until several years after.)
            I, begging the kindness of him, he got it writ
            out for me, and I got another copy writ by Mr
               Smith for myself and so gave my son, 
                  Robert Thornton, that copy which my brother
                     Denton writ for me first out. (To Cambridge.)

            Thus, have I made a long discourse of this
            Book but not in vain; for I humbly bless and
            praise the name of my God for it and that I have
            received a copy,  which was done for a good end though
            not in such a manner. But I am sure we ought
            to express our signal gratitude in living up as
            near as we can, both I and mine, to the pious
            rules and dictates of our holy, good Father. And if
            the Rechabites retained so great a reverence and
            obedience for their fathers' commands (as they 
            did) and so obtained a blessing of their God in
            their obedience, oh, would to God he would please

            that he would give us all that are of his seed, his

            us by our blessed father — which he was teached by
            the spirit of his God, and has confirmed it by
            his practice and instructed us by his holy

            of the truth (in so plain and easy, kind and
            obliging tenderness of a dear father to his
            children) that it will be the greatest act of ingratitude to heaven, and your honoured father's 
            memory, not to make this your rule to walk by
            who left this character for the wisest, virtuous
            and justest man in his time.
           Oh, then, let not, I beseech you, his honour be stained
              in you that are his branches. So shall you, I hope,
            all receive the same reward of your virtue
            
            
            in heaven which I hope you and he may possess

         It is now more than time to return to mention the preservation of the last will and testament
            of my dear father, who first took care of
            our spirituals in his Book and then for our temporal
            estate by his will, disposing his estate in a just
            manner to all his children. And it had certainly been
            so performed — if not prevented by the succeeding
            rebellions in Ireland and England that destroyed
            the estate — we should have had our education out
            of and we was, all of us, obliged to my dear and pious
               mother who, out of her jointure, gave us all the
            bread we eat, and clothes  and all things we enjoyed.

            For which great act of charity and affectionate kindness,
            her children can never enough acknowledge her
            goodness nor speak too much in honour of her holy
            memory. Nor ought we to forget our most humble
            thanks to Almighty God, <span class="quote">our heavenly Father</span>,
            who continued this, our dear parent, so long and to
            give her that heart to embowel herself and estate
            for us when the estate was seized on by the parliament
               
            
            
            and so we all at a loss. (When Kirklington was sequestered
            for my brother, George, who they prosecuted, being
            for the blessed King Charles, the martyr, a sufferer.)
         
         
            But since I must take notice where I left of the
            will — being left on the file in Ireland by my cousin Wandesford — 
            <span class="event" id="ev26-start">I must go back to speak of my brother, George,
            eldest son of my father, and who went into France
            with Mr Anderson for education and stayed so long until
            there could not be any money got out of the estate
            to support him there.</span> And, therefore, called home to my
            uncle, Sir Edward Osborne's, my dear mother's brother,
            being his guardian joined with my mother.
            
       
    <span class="event" id="ev26a-start">
         
            After his return to Hipswell, which was her jointure,
             he told her that he perceived my uncle, William Wandesford,
            was much encumbered with my father's debts and troubles,
            and the creditors was very pressing; so that he
            had a desire to go over into Ireland on purpose to
            get a true copy of my father's will that he might
            see to do everyone right and to pay them their dues.
            To which my dear mother answered, 'Son, it will be very
            well done of you to do so, and God would bless
            you the better to do justice to all and pay debts, as your

               dear father ordered by his will'. Thereupon, my brother, George, did go into Ireland
            about the year 1647.
          
     
          And at his return home, showed my mother
            the copy of the said will out of the court in
             Ireland and attested by Sir William Ryves,
            his hand, to be a true and authentic copy
             of the original will of my father (Sir William
            being the master of that court for probate of
             wills). But my brother, George, told us he owed some money to the
             court for the copying the said will out.
            
         
          My brother then saying to my mother, 'Madam,
            I went into Ireland on purpose to get a copy
            of my father's will, and here is one. And by God's
            grace, I will perform it to a title as much as
            in me lies and do right to you, my sister and
               brothers, my uncle William and to all the creditors
             according to my father's charge at his death'.</span>
        
          
             
             <span class="event" id="ev27-start">            
            My mother said, 'Son, it is a very good act
            of you, and you will be the happier in the good
            performance of it and receive a blessing from God.  
          But, in regard you must keep that copy
            for your own use, and I and your sister wants one
            to repair to, I would have a copy of it to
             keep by me'. My brother said she should have
             one and that he would write it out for her, and if
             he could not get time his brothers, Kitt and John,
            and his sister might get it done amongst them.

            After which he began the copying the will out
            and with his own hand writ on the outside of the
            leaf in great letters — 'The Will: April 1st,
               1647' — 
             and then proceeded to write the first three
            leaves all with his own hand, which copy I have yet.
          
         
            But the treaty of marriage being then begun,
            betwixt Sir John Lowther's eldest daughter and himself, he was so full of business that he never got
            time to write out any more of it, but the rest
            of the copy was writ out by my two brothers, Christopher
            and John, and by myself part of it.
         
         
            All our hands being at it, but the last was my brother
               Christopher's hand, as may appear by his name at
            it and writ (Copia vera) to testify the same.
          </span>
            The witnesses to my father's will were as follows:
            John Burniston, Ralph Wallis, George Straherne, James Foxcraft, Ezra Wollstone.
          
    <span class="event" id="ev28-start">
         
            And this very copy has been ever since in my dear mother's
            hand and my own; being forced to give our testimony
            upon oath concerning the said will when Sir Christopher Wandesford
            came heir (upon the sad loss of my dear brother,
            George) and that the authentic copy was delivered
            to my brother, Christopher, by my uncle, William Wandesford,
            who — upon the delivery of it to him — promised me and
            my mother to let us have it to take a copy by
            at any time, and never denied to give us one a
            long time. But, after his marriage with that lady
            (which his brother, George, should have had,
         
<a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.54&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 54</a>





         
         Sir John Lowther's daughter,
             Mrs Eleanor)
            being many times asked by myself and my
               dear mother — when he came to Hipswell — that
            he would please to give us that copy of the
            will which was my brother George's and that he had
            gone into Ireland on purpose to get one
            out of the court to do right to every one of us
            by it. And also, he, himself, promised faithfully
            to us he would do so too when my uncle
            gave it him in our sight and would let
            us have it to copy one by it. After my brother
               George, his death, he would sometimes have said we should
            have it and he would bring it with him, and other
            times say he had forgotten it but indeed
            we should have it next time.
          And afterwards, about half a year,
            I begged it and prayed him for God's sake to
            let me have it, for I could not get my 
            dues of the tenants which was to pay me by
            my uncle's assignment out of Kirklington
             (which he knew to be true and had gone with me to
             help me to get it of them before he was married).
             Then, he told me that he had laid it where
             he knew not how to find it, nor knew not
             where it was, except Sir John Lowther had it.

          At which answer, I was surprised and much 
            concerned, fearing some ill consequence to
            follow to us because he
             had got it into his hand,
         
         though I was hopeful that my poor brother would
            not be prevailed with to do anything contrary to
            his knowledge of the will of my father (if he
            did but understand the thing rightly).
          So, I still entreated him to look for it and
             get it from Sir John, but durst not speak
             my fears to show any distrust of Sir John.
          But, after this time, my brother Christopher
            would never be known that he had found
            the copy, nor had we any other but that which
            was writ out by us all, in parts, which we repaired
             to on all occasions.
         
      
        
         
            It was about this time that the will was 
            begun to be questioned, </span>   <span class="event" id="ev29-start">though I believe Sir John
            had a design to have destroyed both the will
            and deeds of my dear father in my brother George's
              lifetime, as I have 
            heard and attested by my dear
               brother, George, and my uncle at the last time of their
            meeting with Sir John Lowther, about the terms of the
            match — which was the very last time of the treaty,
            for my brother, George, would not grant to that
            Sir John proposed and so they parted in displeasure.

            It being very late they had their discourse that time — I think, at Sober's in Richmond  — and my uncle William fell asleep on the
            couch when Sir John Lowther and my brother George
            discoursed on their business.
          At last, Sir John told my brother, George,
            that he would never have his estate his
             own, nor free to settle as he would, until the
            will and deeds of his father were all destroyed and then he might settle or dispose as he
            would his estate.
         
            At which motion of Sir John Lowther (was
            my dear brother, being extremely offended) said, 'Sir John, I will never do so unworthy and unjust an action, nor have my
            hand in the destruction of my honoured father's
            will and deeds while I live. And you shall never
            persuade me to it and if I cannot have your
               daughter without it, I will never consent'.
         
            'Then', said Sir John, 'the business is done'.
            
            And parted for that time and ever; </span><span class="event" id="ev30-start">for, God
            knows, he was drowned in going over the
            river Swale on March 31, 1651, being most
            sad and miserable for all our family to lose so good

            and honest a man, who would not do an unworthy or unjust act, though it were in secret and for his advantage.
            </span>
            <span class="event" id="ev31-start">
            That night, after Sir John had made this
            motion to my dear brother (as before) and my uncle
            was sleeping as I told you,
         
            my brother George awaked my uncle William and
            chid him, saying: 'You are sleeping here and
            never mind your business when all lies at
            stake. You little know what Sir John and I have
            done: I might have destroyed you all and you
           never heed!' 'Why', said my uncle, 'what's the matter?'
         
            My dear brother, George, told him 
            what Sir John
            said, thus: 'Did not Sir John make a motion
            to me, and would have had me consent to it, for
            to destroy all my father's deeds and his will.
            And said I should never be master of my own
            estate until I had destroyed my father's will
            and deeds?' Then said my uncle, 'God forbid! Did
            you yield to do it
          'No,' said my dear brother, 'do you think that
            I will ever be such a rogue? God forbid, and
            I will see the old dog hanged before he shall
             ever make me do so wicked a thing. And so, on

              some other words, we parted and the
            business is at an end if he require such
             terms of me'. At which my uncle rejoiced
             to hear such resolute, honest principles
             from so young a man and that he would
            not gain a wife to do an unjust action
             against his father's just will and testament.</span>
          
          
            This one act doth speak much for
             the honour of my deceased brother's memory.
            And I hope he now enjoyeth that blessed
            happiness of keeping his father's command
            when he was tempted to have broken
             them, and that upon the advantage of a match
            and to have advanced his temporal
             estate — if he had done — by many thousands,
             but then he might not had that blessedness
             he, I hope, now enjoys with the God of justice
            forever. I wish this good action in him
            may be a precedent for my son and family to walk by, which makes me be more
            punctual to set down the circumstances
            
            
            of this story.
          
        
    <span class="event" id="ev32-start">
          And, secondly, it too much confirms the

         business to proceed from Sir John Lowther's advice
             and counsel to my second brother, Sir Christopher Wandesford,
            of concealment of the copy aforesaid. And
            then they proceeded to search the rolls 
             office, where the will was proved and put
            on the file as I have related before.
          But since that time (in the year 1647) and
             this year (1652 or 1653) there had been a
             great revolution and change — or changes — in
             the government since my brother, George Wandesford,
             had taken the copy of the will as before related.
            And when search was made for it there,
             there was found no will on the file, nor any
            footsteps of such a will: all things being 
            changed by the Protector Cromwell and his
            instruments, and all those wills and testaments
             then on the file they found was all destroyed
            by the malice of the soldiers and others;
            so that all the kingdom was at a most
            sad loss and damage, and many families was
            destroyed for want of those settlements that
             was then awanting.
         I suppose this news did not a little please
            them at Lowther, whose end it served
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.60&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 60</a>





         
            and forthwith put these designs
            in agitation: declaring publicly that
            a diligent search was made by Sir John's
            means in the Rolls office in Ireland for
            the will of the Lord Deputy Wandesford
            but there was none (nor, the officers that
            was then in the office said, there never had
            been any since they came to it).
          
          
            This sad news was very surprising and

            (with many other essential circumstances
            concerning the knowledge of my said brother,
            Christopher, that there was a will of his
               honoured father) was attested and proved as
            appears by the testimonies aforesaid. Which
            did make it fully appear to the world — and to
            the conscience of my said brother — that it
            was no forgery, nor false pretentions of
            a will made by his father, but such by which
            he himself did acknowledge in his own
            behalf before he was come here and very
            strictly demanded his own education
            money as well as my portion out of Kirklington.
         
            So that this consideration, as touching
            his honour and of that of the family in him, did much
            move my dear mother and myself not to
            let it appear in public as a witness against

            of entering upon the estate on the entail's
            account so well as his brother George)
            did go too far in this affair,

            and my husband, or indeed caused them

            But to return to the sad troubles
            we were all in upon the loss of the will,
            which caused many long and tedious suits
            (Sir Christopher Wandesford suing Mr Thornton,
             my uncle William and the trustees for the
            mean profits of the whole estate in Ireland,
             and laid to their charge above £20000 which, by my dear husband's
            bond to Mr Norton on the taking the assignment,
            did all fall upon him because he entered
            upon the trust and the estate together).
          
          
          
         
            The consequence of these troubles did 
            fall very heavy upon me — in the behalf
            of my poor husband so involved in it 
            — and like to have made me miscarry (being 
            then with child) with grief of all these things.</span>
          
          But still I looked up to the God of
            mercies, which knew all secrets and designs of
            Satan to make us miserable and to be destroyed
            by our own near relations. 
         He knew the truth of my father's will and
            that he had given him wisdom and power to do
            it, and to take care in that for the widow and fatherless.

         Therefore, to him alone, I poured out
            my complaints and showed him of my troubles; for he alone could bring myself and
            dear husband out of all our afflictions

            a solicitor to manage those affairs and to

            if possibly to be had — the name of this man

            same fortune as those on the file had.

             children of my dear father, how he
             (the God of mercies) took care of us and
            all our concerns in giving leave that
             all things was done for the right establishment of peace in this family, and for
            provision and the establishment thereof
             by his will and deeds, and that the will was
            done so legally that we could not totally

            that he would send the sum over to

            or £6,
            with fees and all the charges belonging to it).
         
            But he could not get monies to pay

            court but remained a debt all that time.
          The clerk to whom the fees was due —
            for the securing of his moneys — did keep
            the will of my father, with the probate of
            the same by my cousin Wandesford,
            off the file and laid them very carefully

            could not lose by them.
         The poor clerk died and Mr Kerney still
            kept the chest under safe custody, and none
            came to inquire for their writings. And there
            was such a disturbance in Ireland and that
            city of Dublin that, until there was some
            peace and respite from troubles, he did not see
            fit to look into the chest.
          But now, as it was so ordered by our
            good God in his providence for our relief,
            was the time that Mr Kerney did first
            open this chest, finding many deeds and

            Finding also, Mr Ralph Wallis, his hand,
            as a witness to the will, with four other
            men's hands to it. Also, the probate of
            the said will
            
             as it had been out of the court 
            and put there for custody.
          Mr Kerney, knowing Mr Wallis his
             hand, went forthwith to him and asked
             him if he knew my Lord Deputy Wandesford. 
             Mr Wallis answered, 'Yes', he had reason
             to know and spake greatly in his encomium,
             'but why do you ask that question?' Mr Kerney
             said, 'Do you know your hand when you
             see it?' 'I think I do', said Mr Wallis. 
          At which, Mr Kerney produced my dear
             father's will and showed it to him. Upon
             this, Mr Wallis cried out, 'Oh, my dear lord!
            How joyful am I to see this blessed hand
             again' and, with affectionate tears, he
             kissed his dear lord's hand and name,
             saying, 'I will be deposed of the truth of it.
             That this is my lord's last will and testament',
             and that he, himself, engrossed every word of it,
            being written by his own hand and that it was

             the last act his lord did: to confirm and ratify
            the said last will and testament. Saying, with
             a sad heart, for the want of this will to set
             all right amongst the family we were almost destroyed, asked him how he came by
            it, who told him all the said circumstances as before related.
          
          To which he answered, it was the greatest
            
           providence of God that it was off the file
            in those sad times for they would have 
             been destroyed
           and was also the mercy of God to have
             it now found and restored again, which he hoped
            would be a means to preserve that noble
            family from ruin for want of it.
          He did also assure him, he should be
            gratefully paid for those moneys due
            for the copy Mr George Wandesford had,
            though God knows what a loss there was of that brave
            gentleman in that family. 
          After this, Mr Wallis did with speed and
             great joy acquaint Mr Burniston with it,
            which did much rejoice of its being found
             and attested his hand as witness to it also.

            After Mr Wallis and Mr Burniston had consulted of that business of the will being found,
            they judged it absolutely necessary to seek out
            for William Metcalfe (Mr Thornton's agent) for that 
            employment; acquainting him with that happy
            news of its restoration and of the occasion of the
            will's being taken off the file, as before mentioned.
            All of them did agree with speed to acquaint my
               husband with the good news of this discovery.
          So, Mr Burniston did write to my uncle
            William, and William Metcalfe writ with speed
            to Mr Thornton, and the circumstances of the
            strange preservation of this excellent will of
             my dead, dear father
            which most happy news was so great a
            joy to my dear mother and myself as
            was not imaginable; having laid so long
            concealed, and yet safely preserved from their
             destruction as many others light on that was on
             the file in that time. Blessed and praised be the name of God.
         It was matter of great joy to us, who was
            in great danger to be utterly ruined in our estate
            for the want of it, and especially to my dear
               husband by the assignment of Mr Norton,
            whereby he was so deeply obliged and that
            estate to pay debts was like to be pulled unjustly
            from the children and creditors of my dear father.

          According to Mr Wallis's promise to Mr Kerney,
            all his moneys due to that dead clerk and himself
             was by my husband's order to William Metcalfe fully
             paid and, by advice of Mr Wallis  and Burniston,
            the said original will was again put on the
             file with all the essential ceremonies belonging to
             it. And there, I hope, it will remain preserved
             to the use of the family forever. </span>

            But it was a long time before Sir John 
            Lowther and my brother's agents was satisfied
            of the truth of the said will being found. And
            they put us to a great deal of trouble and cost
            to produce witnesses and such evidences on
            oath that compelled them to be satisfied of the truth
            of the thing, which we were forced to prove upon
            the oaths of Mr Kerney, Mr Wallis and Mr Burniston.
         
         The adversaries to it being unwilling to allow so great a blow to their design, as to enter
            upon my father's estate without satisfaction of
            all dues out of it. Therefore, was raised in court
            objections against us of forgeries and falsehoods,
            with designs to cheat the heir of his estate and
            right, which suits and charges and objections lasted
            for several years against my uncle, William Wandesford,
            and my dear husband to the great loss and
            damage of us all.

            At the last, when much money and time
            was spent in suits, treaties, meetings and motions
            of friends concerning a peaceable agreement
            and composure of differences, and taking up of
            suits, which yet was not obtained until after

             She only lived until she saw the happiness
             of the restoration of my honoured father's will
            by which things was in a posture better to be
             secured than before.

             the suits was in pursuit amongst us; for, though
            all her endeavours was to make peace in the
             family, yet — such was the inveterate hatred
             had been created by some persons — that all
            motions and mediations was in vain but they
            pursued on their designs to destroy us.
          Yet, since by the mercies of our good God, we
             had a good cause in hand, we and she hoped (with
             that, the will, being produced in its full vigour) that
             the law would at last judge our cause aright,
             and in equity relieve us if we did not prevail
            for a peaceable composure.

            state of the case to be made known to Baron
               Thorpe, who took cognisance of the matter,
            and an agreement was stated amongst us.
         All suits ended, and Mr Thornton was
            to deliver up the estate of Idough in Ireland
            to trustees upon the performance of the said
            trust of my honoured father's last will and testament,
            which was entered into bond to be done by Sir Christopher
               Wandesford for the performance of the same, according
            to that will which he had so much denied
            before. (The Lord pardon his great sin.)
         
            Yet, by the great providence of the Almighty God, he had brought the truth to pass : that
            he could not enter into possession of that land
            of his father without the satisfaction of debt,
            portions and creditors due to be paid out of
            the same. (<span class="evquote">Blessed be the Lord, our God, forever</span>.)
          Which by this agreement, with my uncle William
             and my dear husband, according to Baron
            Thorpe's arbitration, all things (blessed be God)
             was stated and compromised, and deeds and 
            articles of conditions was drawn amongst
             us by Sir Christopher Wandesford, my brother, and my
                husband and my uncle, William Wandesford.

         By virtue of the said agreement, there
            was made three deeds, or rentcharges, to secure
            a rentcharge to Mr Thornton for all his
            moneys due to him out of the said lands
            of Idough in Ireland to secure the sum
            of £2000 to Mr Thornton.
          
             Videlicet: to pay my own £1000,
             part of my portion, which by my father's will
            he gave me out of his land in Ireland, as an increase  of what he had already given me out of
             Kirklington: videlicet, £1500
             portion.
         
         
            I, having due to me in all, by my father's 
            will and testament, the sum of £2500 as 
            portion. Besides, I ought to have by his will
            a sufficient allowance for maintenance and 
            education until I came to the age of 21 years
            or marriage (which first happened, with consent
            of my dear mother) to be maintained according to my degree and quality, which maintenance
            I never yet got one penny of it though due for
            many years: so, I was not burdensome for that,
            yet it doth still remain due to me.
          Also, Sir Christopher Wandesford did by that rentcharge pay and satisfy Mr Thornton for that
             debt of Mr Nettleton, which was paid by Mr

         Thornton to Mr Nettleton according to
             the agreement betwixt Sir Christopher Wandesford and Mr Thornton.

          After which it was judged safe for Mr Thornton,
            and but necessary by Mr Thornton's counsel, to have
            a release from Sir Christopher Wandesford to Mr
               Thornton (dated,

            poor brother upon the denial of 
            his father's will
            to our great sorrow and affliction (because he knew
            there was one, and had acted according to it in
            his own behalf and mine when he was a younger
            brother) —

          
         
            by reason of all these circumstances, the
            acting in that business proved of an unhappy
            consequence to my dear husband and his estate,
            and created him more trouble than ever he
            would have known.
          
            For, on the contrary, if he had not been engaged
            in that trust to pay off debts faster than it could
            by their suing him for them — after he had 
            given Nettleton security for his, then did my
            uncle William Wandesford demand his debt from Mr Thornton
            and so took up the rents with charges more than
            was gotten out of the land — by reason of which, Mr
            Thornton was forced to enter into debt and to
            sell his land at Burn Park to pay them 
          (which, with interest and public charges, outrun
            a great part which should have paid his two daughters' portions and maintenance).</span>

            only stuck to my mother's interest of £300 per annum
            out of that estate annuity for her life,

            which was due for 19 years after my
               father's death, and was first charged on the
            trust, being in lieu of that estate due by law
            for thirds and so settled by my dear father by
            deed of annuity, and confirmed by his will.
         
            The sum which was due to her being to the
            value of £6000. I heard
            Sir John Lowther promise my mother for it
            £1500 for to quit her
            interest there.
          
             I do believe she would have accepted of it,
            if left to herself, but the same parties which advised Mr Thornton to the taking on him the trust did
             advise my mother to the contrary, and so she
            did not accept of Sir John's motion when he was
            to pay her that money all down at a payment.
            However, she would have made over her
            dues there to Mr Thornton, by which he might
            have entered on the estate in her right,</span>
          
         
            and so have had an entire interest before
            debts however might have been sharers with them.
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev59-start">
         
            Also, there was a right due to my poor 
               brother, John Wandesford, of £6000
            out of Ireland,
            which fell on him by my father's will when
            Christopher became heir by my brother George Wandesford's

            death without heirs, as now it was. And he made
            me, his only sister, his executor and gave it to
            me (besides there was my own portion of
             £1000 which was to have been paid
            from that estate without dispute).</span>
          
          
         
            Now, if all these interests should have failed,
            it would have been strange and an unaccountable
            
            thing when there was such an estate, worth
            £2000 a year to pay it out
            on, besides a great colliery.
          
          
    
            But there was no fear by God's grace
            of that, being all secured by the will, by which right
            was obtained what I did enjoy; having also
            my uncle William Wandesford's security and deed of
             annuity of two rentcharges — first, of £100 per annum for six years; the second, for £200 per annum for five years to be received out
            of Kirklington for my £1500 — <span class="event" id="ev60-start">besides other and
            better security by articles made betwixt my
               said uncle William, my brother, Christopher Wandesford,
             and my uncle, Richard Darley,  in my behalf 
            before my marriage.
         
            Upon which the articles of marriage was made
            betwixt Mr Thornton and  my mother, with the
            settlements of his estate at East Newton, et cetera.

         And Leysthorpe was made according to the
            several articles and agreements at that time
            (July 2nd,
               1651) as may more at large appear.
         </span>
          
          
         
            But since things fell out contrary to our
            hopes and desires for Mr Thornton's peace and
            quiet, with more impairing of our estate than
            could have been wished, we have great reason to bless and praise the Lord, our God, that
            it was no worse, which it would have been without doubt had not divine providence so
            ordered that the will of my dear father
            was, first, out of harm's way and off the file
            when those lawless times endured.
          And yet to be found in due time, when we
             were like to be overthrown by our adversaries,
            and even in the nick of time to be produced
             to preserve us (and all who had an interest in
             it) from destruction.
         
            Therefore, we may 
            say in regard of this providence of the will, as a good man said of himself:
            <span class="quote">had it not been lost, we had been lost
            and had it not been found again, we had
            been lost</span>. Thus, mercies express themselves by
            means, with means, without means, and above
            means all to the glory of God, our great Creator.

          Oh, look, Lord — I humbly beseech

         if we fear thee and keep <span class="quote">thy commandments</span>.
             Now, since such danger and misery that accrued
             to me by the act of the first Adam, O Lord, I humbly
            desire that I may take hold of the covenant of grace
             which the second Adam hath prepared for us.
          And that I may evermore magnify thy great and
            unspeakable mercies in sending thy only son to
            become man for us, <span class="quote">who, being without sin, suffered
            for sin, that we — who were nothing but only sin —
            might be made rich by the imputation of his
            all-sufficient righteousness</span>.
          But, dear <span class="quote">father of mercies</span>, such is my
            infirmities and weakness that I have been so far 
             from acknowledging thy infinite goodness towards us,
            in sending thy only son to redeem us when we
            were utterly lost; so far from being thankful to
            him for his unspeakable love to <span class="quote">me that was contented to
            suffer even the scornful death of the cross for my
            sake</span>; so far from the participation of his virtues
            or the imitation of his virtues and holiness, and examples 
          that those laws (which either by the instinct of
            nature, or by divine precept thou hast charactered in
             our hearts) I have, inasmuch as in me laid, razed out
            by adding
             actual to original sin.
         
          <span class="quote">O Lord, I humbly cast myself down before thy

            against me who hath not walked according to
            thy holy laws and precepts.
          And yet, O Lord, I confess myself more vile
            and sinful in thy pure sight in so often and more
             frequently broken thy commandments in <span class="quote">thought,
             word and deed</span> by the breach of my duty to thee,
            my <span class="quote">heavenly Father</span>;

           O Lord, I have broken those righteous
            laws which thou hast <span class="quote">commanded me to walk

            my enemies or praying for my persecutors or

            been moved too high in degree when I have been wronged
             by them and injured — either in my body, goods and good
             name — and has been too apt take my own cause in my
             hand to vindicate my wronged innocency myself.
         
            Whereas, alas, I ought wholly 
            to have left my
            cause to thy holy majesty to both defend and deliver, and revenge my cause. For thou only are <span class="quote">the
            judge of the world</span> and canst deliver me from all the
            wrongs I have sustained and justify thy handmaid, who has made it my endeavour to walk
            uprightly before thee, and men, in chastity and honesty.
          Therefore, I abhor myself in <span class="quote">dust and ashes</span> for
            my too much grieving and impatiency when men
             was set against me and not to suffer with that humility,
            
            
            patience and submission

             me because I did not consider that I had
            merited more than their malice could do by
             my uneven walking before thy holy majesty,

            against thy gracious returns of prayers, and my vows
            and tears and repentance; in relapses into sin, notwithstanding all my vows and resolutions; in neglect
            of prayers, meditations, sermons, convictions, and thy
            often frequent preservations of me and mine; in
            sinning against thy often and manifold deliverances
            from dangers, sicknesses, destructions prepared for my
            soul and body by spiritual and temporal foes.
          O Lord, my God, what have I done to be so 
             vile an unworthy, ungrateful and forgetful wretch,
             after all these miraculous mercies and wonders?

            ever since I was born <span class="quote">in thought, in word
            and deed</span> by breaking all thy holy and sacred
             commandments, laws and precepts.
          By sins of omission, sins of commission,
             with all the aggravations of time and circumstances;
             sins, of weakness; sins, too often, in some kind

             myself from

            deep as scarlet, I shall become as white as
             snow</span>, even in the <span class="quote">precious blood</span> of the holy Jesus.
          But, alas, I am not able to cast myself into this pool, such is my lameness
            and imbecility,
             without the help of thy Holy
             Spirit to work me — thy poor, weak
             handmaid — such a sorrow and contrition
            that may change and alter this <span class="quote">flinty heart of

            and emulation to good persons in works of piety.
         To work upon my revenge and punishment
            of myself for my sins in weeping, fasting
            and prayer, in sedulity
            and watchfulness against
            opportunity and temptations to avoid even
            the appearances of evil and for my sins.
          For, if I would judge myself, I should
             not be indeed of thee, O Lord.
          Oh, therefore, send me strength, I humbly
             beseech, O my God, to <span class="quote">punish my spiritual
             sins of pride, contempt of God, disobedience,
             wrath, anger, foolishness, desire of revenge,
            looking after vanities</span>, neglect of duties, 
         with <span class="quote">a calling to mind (with sorrow and

            to be patient to put up wrongs, to be ready
            to forgive by setting my desires on good and
            heavenly things.
          And give me grace, I humbly beseech thee,
             O Father, to punish my sins as to the world 
             of uncleanness by infirmities of nature: of intemperance, ease, sleep and the like, with chastening
             my body with abstinence, fasting, watching,

         meditations, reading thy holy word, prayer
            in receiving thy Holy Sacrament, and constant
             devotion and regularity in all my ways and actions.
          Help me, I also beseech thee, dear Father,
             to punish my worldly sins of covetousness,
            ambition or desiring after the outward advantages of this world  — if, at any time, I have
            wished or gotten anything contrary to thy
             law — by making restitution, by being compassionate
            and bountiful to my fellow members.
          Then shall I, by thy goodness, not only be
            freed from the imputation or sins of my fore-past life, but bestow my future course of life
             (and this sad widow condition of estate into
            which thou hast brought me into) 
         in a constant walking the ways of life and
            godliness, going from grace to grace, from
            good work to good work, until I attain to that
            measure of perfection which thou hast appointed
            to me during the time of my earthly pilgrimage
            here; that so, I may order my life and conversation here as becomes a sober, wise and 
            holy widow, since thou hast pleased to entitle me to a double share of thy care and 
            protection,

          both as to a fatherless and helpless creature,
            I humbly depend alone on thy gracious 
            mercy and favour.
          Beseeching thee, O <span class="quote">Father of mercies</span>, to
             accept of my soul and body in thy service,
             and to preserve and guide me, and <span class="quote">deliver
             me from all evils</span> (both spiritual and
            temporal) and to assist me with thy grace
             to bring up my three children, whom thou
             hast made orphans, in thy fear and
            nurture of the Lord.
          Give both me, thy handmaid, and them
            <span class="quote">a double share of thy Holy Spirit</span> that we
             may do our duties to thee, <span class="quote">our heavenly Father</span>,
             and to each other; serving thee, our God, with all
             the powers and faculties of our mind and hearts,
             we may, at length (after thou hast finished
             our days here) serve and glorify thee, O God,
            to all eternity. And that none of our souls
            may be lost but be made great instruments
            of thy praise; living in thy fear and
             dying in thy favour, we may rest in thy
            glory.

         But since I have presumed to speak unto
            the Lord — O Lord, the holy and righteous — I do
            humbly beseech thy gracious majesty to fit
            and prepare my heart to meditate upon that
            great goodness, and to set forth thy glory and

            for me and my poor family. But, most of all,
            to myself ever since I was born, and before I
            came into this life, until this time of my widowhood condition.
         Humbly desiring thy grace and assistance to
            make mention of thy infinite and manifold
            deliverances vouchsafed to thy handmaid
            since I was born (February 13, 1626) until this day
            of my change from a virgin and married
            estate until am entered into the widow
            estate (September 17th, 1668). And that I may
            praise and magnify thy holy name for what thou
            hast done for me forever. Accept, therefore, of
            the <span class="quote">meditations of my heart</span>, my praises and thanksgivings from all the bottom of my heart and 
            soul for thy inexpressible goodness to me and

             his handmaid, in the deliverance of the copy

          Yet did our gracious <span class="quote">Father of mercies</span> then
            preserve this excellent Book of my father's
             which was an unspeakable mercy to me and my children,
            and my father's whole family, and for which
            goodness of the Lord, we are forever bound

            curse, instead of a blessing</span>, by walking contrary to our forefather's commands in the
             right manner of serving our God.
             Oh, then, let us be as careful and be obedient to the commands of our holy Father
            in serving our God conscientiously in its
             practice as the Rechabites was to obey their
             father, Jonadab, in forbearing <span class="quote">wine</span>.
          Then may we be, by God's grace, hopeful
             to enjoy that blessing which God gave to his children:
            <span class="quote">that they should not want a man to go

             <span class="quote">oh, sing you praises with understanding</span>.
          Next to the blessing of my father's Book
            and preserving it to our posterity, we did all
            so receive a great mercy by the right
            ordering of my father's temporal concerns
            by the making and ordaining of his last will and
            testament in a perfect and just and upright
            manner; settling and disposing of his estate

so as all concerned in it was rightly provided
             for (either his widow, children, friends and
            creditors by which justice, equity and charity
            was rightly disposed for and no person injured).
          This so wise and bountiful disposal of that estate —
            which God had graciously given him upon his
             honest industry and endeavours, who had paid
            all his grandfather's debts — God had increased
            his store to six-fold of what my grandfather had
             left to him.
          So, as he had gotten and increased his estate so
            much by his honest ways and payment of his
               father's debts, now he (as wisely) leaves it to his
                  children and family with a blessing, and settled it by
            deeds and will to preserve every branch thereof by
             noble and paternal divisions (making and disposing the same by the said last will and testament).
          <span class="quote">Oh, how can I sufficiently set forth</span> the great
            goodness of the Lord in giving such riches
             and increase of my father's estate? And, also, in 
            giving to my father such tender affections towards me and us all, whereby we were nobly provided
             for to live in the world and to do good with this also as
             by his example. And, likewise, in giving my dear

          This cousin of that Lord's had lived a year

             a protestant and married to an English woman,

            but knew not what — found the said Lord McMahon and other
            two rebels (the heads of them, Lord Maguire and Sir
               Phelim O'Neill) all in a blind ale house, drinking . They showed glad of his coming, so made
            him sit down and drink with them until he (having
            got out the plot what they intended to do,
            as it is related at full in my 'First Book of

            holy Lord and saviour's Jesus Christ, to be a God reconciled to me, and gave me the happy opportunity
            to receive the pledge of thy love to us, poor creatures,
            in the first time of approaching to thy holy table
            in the receiving the Communion from that good man
            Mr Wilson, at our parish church, St Michael's in Westchester.
          
          I endeavoured to come prepared with as much zeal,
            humility, repentance and devotion as I was capable
             of, yet with great fear and trembling, to approach
             to so mysterious and sacred an ordinance (wherein
            the mysteries of our salvation is made known to
             me, how unworthy I am to approach to so divine
            
             a feast with such unclean and unholy a heart).</span>
          Yet, since I am commanded, by our dearest
             Jesus,
            <span class="quote">to come unto him all those that are weary and heavy
             laden with sin, and he would give us ease</span>,
         he has made me partaker of his outward 
            ordinance in this Sacrament. Lord, bless this, thy
            holy ordinance to the pardon of my sins, the healing
            
            
            of my soul and to the strengthening of my faith
            and fulfilling me with all graces.
          Being made partaker, thereof, it may be effectual
             to fill me with thy spirit, renewing thy grace and the
             sanctification of my heart <span class="quote">to walk in newness of
             life</span>; <span class="quote">in all godliness and honesty</span> to walk before thee,

             sake and bloodshed upon the cross, O holy Jesus,

             and tears, and grant me thy
            blessings on the head of thy handmaid
            and keep me upright all my days that I may
             serve thee faithful, forever.
          For thou, O God, whose mercies are as high
            as the heavens, as great and many as the moments of eternity, thou hast opened thy hand
            wide to fill me with all blessings and the sweet
            effects of thy loving kindness. <span class="quote">Thou art pitiful as a mother to me and provided a tender</span>

            and extreme merciful to all them that fear
            thee; to me, in particular, in giving me not only
            food and raiment and necessaries for this life,
            but also has drawn into communion
            with thee by thy word, and spirit and holy Sacraments.

            to fill my soul with great apprehensions and
            impresses of thy unspeakable mercies and goodness

         Having lived a sweet, quiet and comfortable
            time of my life from my birth until I had completed the 26th year of my life, under the conduct of my dear mother's care and government,
            
         
         <span class="event" id="ev97-start">
            then was that affair of a treaty of marriage

            father-in-law) in not joining in the fine — which should
            and ought to have been paid by him to secure a settlement
            for my children and for a jointure in lieu of

            as soon as Mr Gates was either consenting

          Upon which, the articles of marriage was drawn
             by Mr Thornton's own hand, signed and sealed, and
            a deed of settlement made accordingly of
            all his estate, East Newton and Leysthorpe
             accordingly (July 2nd, 1651: dated).
             And, also, another deed of settlement of
            Burn Park for provision of younger children's
             portions and maintenance (of the same date aforesaid).
          After which, a fine passed and all done that could
             be done (as long as old Mr Gates lived) to secure
             the said estate according to articles of marriage.</span>
          
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev98-start">
          Then, upon the 15th of December 1651,
            my marriage was solemnly performed by Mr
               Syddall,
               
            
            very grave and religiously, who 
            
            was witnessed by  many of my relations and
             Mr Thornton's; being done according to the Church

            two
            
               
             o'clock, fall into a most violent fit of a sudden
            sickness with pains of my head and back and stomach
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.133&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 133</a>





         
            
            
         
         in a fever and ague, which seized on me in so
            great a violence that it caused me to vomit and
            purge extremely, until my strength was almost
            gone, and brought into great faintings for eight hours long.
         Which condition was extremely bewailed by my
            husband and mother, and my friends, and looked upon
            as a sad omen to my future comfort.
            And I do confess, I was very desirous to have
            then delivered up my miserable life into the hand
            of my merciful redeemer, who I feared I had 
            offended by altering my resolves of a single life.
          This sickness (as to natural causes) proceeded
            from a desperate cold taken the night before upon
            washing my feet, which I never used to do in such
             cold time of the year, in deep of winter. And so that
             struck up into my head and stomach and caused that
             great and violent extremity of vomit and purging.
          But, after the great cleansing of my stomach
            and upon all the means could be used, it pleased
            my gracious God to look upon me in much 
             mercy and to abate my sickness and torments, and did
            give me some ease that night and caused me to
             sleep tolerably well. Thus, was the first entrance
            of my married life, which began in sickness and
            continued in much afflictions and ended in great
            sorrows and mournings.

          So that — which was to others accounted the 
            happiest estate — was embittered to me at the
            first entrance and was a caution of what
            trouble I might expect in it; as was hinted 
             by St Paul's Epistle, <span class="evquote">such shall have trouble in
             the flesh</span>.
               
         </span>
          
          I only had the hopes of comfort in my
            dear husband, whose sweet and good
            conversation alleviated much of my other
            sorrows. Thou, O Lord, my God, did not forsake
            me in the midst of my pains and sickness
            
            
            when I was brought very low, but gave me
            help, strength and comfort to endure thy hand
            gently, laying it on me as a trial and graciously taking it off me again in a short time,
          so that I saw thy power, thy justice and
            thy clemency to spare my life in this world
            to serve thee in a married estate as well 
            
            as in a single life (in which I was well pleased,
            if my mother and friends had seen it fit).
          But since, by thy divine providence, I am
             entered into this estate of marriage, I beseech
             thee, O Lord, to give me those graces and gifts which
            I want and what is requisite to make me a suitable wife (as thy servants <span class="quote">Sarah</span> and <span class="quote">Rebecca</span> was)
            and to imitate them in their virtues.

          After my recovery of this illness, it pleased
             God to cause me to conceive with child, and I

            order, with the heat of blood being helped more
            forward in the distemper by the extreme heat
            of the weather at that time (when the extreme
            great eclipse of the sun was in its height and
            a great and total eclipse fell out this year, 1652).
          At which time, I was big with child and the sight of it
            much affrighted me: it being so dark in the
             morning at breakfast time (and came so suddenly
             on us that in a bright sunshine morning) that he
             could not see to eat his breakfast without a candle.
             But this did amaze me much, and I could not

         refrain going out into the garden and look
             on the
             eclipse in water; discovering the power of God so great
             to a miracle, who did with draw his light from our sun
             so totally that the sky was dark, and stars appeared,
            and a cold storm for a time did possess the earth.
         
            Which dreadful change did put me into most
            serious and deep consideration of the <span class="evquote">day of judgement</span>,
            <span class="evquote">which would come as sudden and as certainly upon
               all the earth</span> as this eclipse fell out,</span> which caused me to
            desire and beg of his majesty that he would prepare
            me for this great day in repentance, faith and a
            holy life: for the judgements of God was just and
            certain upon all sins and sinners. Oh, prepare me,
            O God, for all thy dispensations and trials in this
            world, and <span class="quote">make me ready and prepared with oil in my
            lamp, as the wise virgins against the coming
            of the sweet bridegroom of my soul</span>.

            The time was so hot and I, unusually, had my
            blood stayed being with child, so that I had an
            accident fell on me not usual: my nose fell out
            of bleeding as I was sitting at my work and bled
            upon my apron. At which sudden motion, I was
            a little amazed (being unusual to me) and I would
            have been let blood to cool me at that time which I know
            would have done me good but (not being a thing there
            usual to women with child to bleed) it was not consented
            to, nor I could obtain leave of Mr Thornton nor my dear mother

because they durst not for fear of a prejudice
            to my child, so that I did submit to their
            judgements having more experience than myself.</span>
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev103-start">
         
            About a month after, Mr Thornton desired
            (and his relations) that I should go to see them
            both at Crathorne, Buttercrambe, York and
            at Hull and Beverley, at Burn Park where his
               mother lived then.  My dear mother was not so
            free to give me leave because I was in that
            condition (big with child, of my first) which might
            work some ill effect in my health.
         But my dear husband's
             
             kind importunity
            prevailed, and so we took our journey and by
            God's mercy did I go to all those places where
            his friends lived and most kindly received
             and entertained. (I bless God who gave me favour
            in their eyes of my husband's friends.)
          When I came to Hull, Dr Wittie would
            have had me advised to be let blood because
             of my heat and sweating, inclining to a fever
             by my journey. I would gladly have done it,
             but Mr Thornton could not stay two days longer.
            
             In my return home by Newton, when I
             saw the old house (the remains of it) as I was
             in the great chamber, the door into a little room
            was so low as I got a great knock on my

forehead, which struck me down and I fell with the
             force of the blow, at which my husband was troubled.
             But I, recovering my astonishment because he should
            not be too
             much concerned, smiled and said I hope I
            was not much worse but said I had taken
            possession. Which made him smile and said it was to
             my hurt and indeed, so it was many ways.
          
          
    
          For, in my going homeward, he carried me to
            that place of the great rocks and cliffs which is called
             Whitestone Cliff which I knew not, but was a mile to the
            bottom, where I could not tread one step even
             down but on my toes (being held up by my maid,
                Susan Gosling) which so strained my body, being near
             my time, that I went down in pain and did
            sweat exceedingly.
         But this my husband would not have had
            me gone down this way (but by Ampleforth about
            and plane way) but for Mr Bradley, who told him
            it would not do me no hurt because his wife
            went down that way and was no worse.
          However, this effect to me was contrary; for
             I, being to go to my cousin Ayscough's, she did admire
            that I came that way and wished I might get safe home.
          It was, indeed, the good pleasure of my God to
             bring me safe home to my dear mother's house Hipswell,

            <span class="event" id="ev106-start">
             but my dangerous journey — the effects of it — did
             soon appear on me and Dr Wittie's words came true.

For as soon as I got home, I fell into the most 
            dreadful sickness that ever any creature could
            possibly be saved
             out of, and by a strong and putrid
             fever (which was on me 11 days before Dr Wittie
             came from Hull) had so putrefied my whole blood
             that both myself and poor infant was like to go.
          But when the doctor came post, I heard that post
             sound and, though I was almost past speaking, did
            yet rejoice in hopes he would let me blood which
             by no means else I thought I could not live.
          I was so recruited a little moment, when
             he saw me, that he thought to let me blood forthwith
             but, after a little space, I fell down so ill that he
            durst not do it until he had given me something
             to cause an hour's sleep (which I had not done in all
             my sickness before). Upon which, he did let blood
             and then, in a quarter of an hour's time, I bless my God,
            I grew better.
         
            (The more particular description of this great
            and long-lasting sickness, I have related in my 'First
               Book of My Life' and with the miraculous deliverances
            was towards me in all that time.)</span>
          
         
          <span class="event" id="ev107-start">
            For after my miscarriage of that sweet
               infant, which I bore with great difficulty and it was
            sodden in my womb by the fever, it could not
            live a quarter of an hour until we could get it baptised,
            though we sent for a minister to do it.

    <span class="event" id="ev108-start">
         And after that I fell into a long-lasting ague,
            sometimes by a tertian, and then every day had
            it until I sweat and changed three times in one day and night.
          Then I fell into the jaundice after the ague,
             which so continued with me so terribly that my strength,
             my might, my hopes was gone of life.
          The hair on my head came off, my nails off
             my fingers and toes came off, my teeth did shake
            and ready to come out and grew black. 
          And thus did this dreadful, chronical disease
             remain on me so long that — in all these things —
            I continued out of one distemper into another
            for the space of nine months, with the relapses and the
            weaknesses that followed: so that it was from the
             6th
                of August 1652 until May 12th, 1653, after
            before I was able to go out of my chamber or
            had recruited my strength any degree.</span>
          
          Thus, have I passed the first two years of
            my married estate in a most sad and uncomfortable
             condition; being void of health, ease and comfort
             to the great affliction of myself, husband and dear mother.

            After the Lord vouchsafest me a degree
            of strength and recovery — out of that desperate,
            long-lasting sickness by five or six several relapses
            down into an ague, from which God did at last
            bring me through much weakness and faintings — 
          
             about a quarter of a year, I found myself as if I was in a breeding condition and
            very often sick, as in those cases with me, after
            meat.
          
          
    
         Which was some hopes to my husband I
            might possibly be better in health, after I was
            with quick child and so, I bless God, I was for
            some time. But about the same of the year, in
            August, when my first sickness began and that
            I was about 11 or 12 weeks gone, I perceived the
               child to move and that I was with 
            which was a great joy to us both (hoping I might
            have missed the fever).
          But about that time in August, I found the child
             for three weeks very lively and well. But, after a while,

I found myself very hot and feverish, and the child
            did not move at all which caused me to be afraid
             of a relapse into the same distemper as on the first.
            
            
             And, therefore, begged of my husband and mother
             they would please to give me leave to be let blood,
           which they consented to, and I got Mr Mahum to do
            it. And took four or five ounces from my arm, upon which I
            found a most quick change and the poor infant
            did spring in my womb, very lively and strong, by the
            refreshment it got by cooling the fever.
         The child continuing very brisk and well ever
            after, and I remained healthful until within a month
               of my time — growing big and uneasy, and full of pains —

             betwixt five and six o'clock in the afternoon.
             At which time, in great and exquisite torments and
             peril of my life, I was — by the miraculous goodness
             of my gracious God — delivered of my second

            I fell with child of my third child and, being in a

            About a week before my travail, I continued in

            by friends' importunity) by God's blessing she was
            better but could not come to me in my labour.

            the young infant in another,
          she fell into a most desperate fit of the
            convulsions as supposed to be. Her breath stopped,
            grew black in her face, which sore frighted her
            maid, Jane Flower. She took her up immediately and, with the help of the midwife, Jane Rimer,
            to open her teeth and to bring her to life again.
          But still, afterwards, no sooner that she
            was out of one fit but fell into another fit

            me extremely. And all the time of this poor 
               child's illness, I, myself, was at death's door by
            the extreme excess of those (upon the fright and
            terror came upon me) so great floods that I was
            spent and my breath lost. My strength departed
            from me and I could not speak for faintings and dispirited, so that my dear mother and aunt and friends did
            not expect my life but overcome with sorrow for me.
         
            Nor durst they tell me in what a condition my 
               dear Nally was in her fits, lest grief for her
            (added to my own
            extremity with loss of blood) might 
            have  extinguished my miserable life.

             grievous cry, said my dear Nally was either
            dead, or very near it, in the cradle in the nursery.
         
            Which did so suddenly affright me, being
            weak as before, and this flood came down upon

            comply with their judgements. She did perform

            My dear sweet, beautiful child, Elizabeth

             of September 
            1656

            After my dear Betty's death — about a quarter of 
            a year — it pleased God I had hopes of breeding another child which might be a comfort to us and an
            increase of God's kingdom. Although I could not be
            blamed to fear my own life might go in some of
            those extremities but even in that, too, I am teached
            to say <span class="evquote">the will of the Lord be done</span>.
            
            
    
         
            I always breed my children very sickly and ill
               health but, blessed be the Lord, had my health indifferently after quick child. And thus, continued
            in a good state of health of this, my fifth child,</span><span class="event" id="ev130a-start">until
            I, most unfortunately, going over the hall at Hipswell , my gown skirt wrapped about my feet and
            so twisted that I could not loosen it before it cast me
            a desperate fall, which I fell upon my hands and knees
               to save my child. But the very weight of my body
            (with the fall over the threshold in the hall at Hipswell)
            did so shake me that the child was turned wrong in
            my womb. I, being then big with child, wanted but ten 
            weeks of my time (on September 14th,
               1657).

            Upon which fall, it cast me into a great fever
               and the jaundice followed. And about three weeks was very
               weak, in great danger of death and miscarrying
            with the continual pains and exercise of the child
               beturned wrong in my womb, whose motions would
            have had itself right again by continually
               bending its head and back for it, nor could my
            dear babe bend its head aright which we could
               discern on the outside. My case was so ill that
            Dr Wittie was sent for, who used all his art
               to preserve myself and the child, saying that I was with
            child of a son he was confident but should have
            difficult labour.
            He, having used all his skill to preserve the
               stock, by the blessing of God,  I was preserved from
            death and marvellously restored to health and
               strength (being let blood and other remedies which made
               me go to my full time).</span><span class="quote">Oh, what shall I render to

          Notwithstanding all my sickness, dangers and
            extremities my body endured by the late dreadful
             fall, yet such was the boundless goodness and mercies
             of my gracious <span class="evquote">Father of heaven</span> — upon a blessing
             of the good means I had — to restore my strength to
             go to my full time (though still in pains, on the great
            motions my dear infant forced to turn himself
             right for the coming into the world and could not do it).
          My labour came on me on the Monday, continued
             until Wednesday. In travail, the 9th of December, I fell into
             exceeding sore and sharp labour in great extremity,
             and strong birth and bearing throes in exquisite torments,
             so that the midwife believed I should be soon delivered.
          But, alas, it proved not so but fell out to the contrary
             for the poor child stuck in the birth, nor could come
             right, being cross with his poor legs and feet (the one being
             turned back and the other across my body) and the head and
             neck turned backward way by my fall.
          In this condition, I continued until Thursday morning.

            The midwife would make me go to bed — I, being
             near spent — though I only desired to lie down and
            take a little respite to make me to go through what
             I was to do. But she made me go to bed, and then
            my pains sharpened so fast they could not get
            me up nor could she deliver me in the bed.
          But, at length, got me on the stool (with my clothes
             half on and shoes off) and, about two or three o'clock in the
             morning, my torments began more sharp and
            the labour more hard; so that I was upon the
             rack for six hours together in torment, and crying
            so long and bitter that my poor body was as if
            parted limb from limb; so that I grew speechless and breathless a long time, for this dear
                  child was pulled away in my extremities. And
             first, one foot came; then, the other was drawn
             down. Then, the arms being over his head and
             shoulders, so that she wrought upon my poor
            body and my dear infant with her hands
             on his hips and thighs, which stuck fast, which — having
             removed and brought him down to his arms —
            all this while was I in exquisite torture.
          Then did she work down and fetch his arms:
             at one time after did bring down the other, when
            his head was stuck and his shoulders fast.

         And, lest my body should close again, she did
             pull away his head and neck with such a force — not
            giving me time or space to breathe — that both our breaths
            was lost
             for a time, though (by the infinite boundless
             mercies of my gracious God and great Creator) my
             breath was again restored to me, a poor creature,
            but my sweet infant's was taken from him.
          </span><span class="event" id="ev132-start">
             And though he stirred a little, yet, being almost strangled
             in birth, he could not recover; only living half
             an hour and so departed (I, giving him up into the
             hand of my <span class="evquote">heavenly Father</span> who spared me, his
             handmaid, and took his soul into his holy place).
            Though we could not have the happiness of baptism for
             him, though a minister was sent for, yet he departed
             before he came, and — where it was not neglected by us
             and the means could not be had — I trust in the mercies of
             the Lord for his salvation: he requiring no more than
            he gives. And his infinite grace was to me in sparing 
             my soul from death; though my body was torn in pieces,
            my soul was miraculously delivered from death.
         I was delivered in the manner rehearsed by the fall I
            got of him, of this, my fifth child and first-born
            son, on the 10th day of December 1657. He was buried
            in Catterick church by Mr Syddall that same day.</span><a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.164&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 164</a><span class="event" id="ev133-start">
         The weakness of my body and spirits was so
            exceeding great, of long continuance, that it put

            together that I should live or recover.
          And when, by the goodness of my gracious God,
             I did recruit a little (upon all the comforts and
            refreshments of my dear mother and husband's
            kindness and affection to me in suffering so much
             in bearing children to him),
          yet I was seized on with a new trouble by that
            loss of blood in the bleeding of the haemorrhoids
            for every day, half a year together, which came
            on me by the being torn by my child.
         And a lameness on my left knee I got when
            I was in labour for want of help skilful to hold
            me fast in labour; so that I was forced to be carried

         followed every day by siege caused by my
            last sore travail and sad childbirth.
         This brought me so low and weak that fainted
            every day upon such occasions (when I daily
            lost about four or five ounces of blood).
            It was Dr Wittie's opinion that I was deeply gone
            in a consumption and, if that continued, I should
            be barren, having my blood and spirits gone,
          which things was considered by my husband
            and mother. They were resolved from Dr Wittie's advice
            and opinion to look the best help that could be.
            Blessed be the Lord God of mercy which caused my
            friends to have pity on me and to seek for help.
            This was pitched upon: that I should go to
               Scarborough Spa for the cure of that sad distemper.
               And, accordingly, I went with my husband and stayed
               about a month there until I recovered some strength.
            In which time, by the infinite and wonderful
            mercies of the Lord and his blessing upon drinking of 
               the waters, I recovered my strength by degrees.
            After the curing of me of that infirmity of bleeding, it, to a wonder, left me within two days and I was
            totally cured of it, and in that months' time was also
               cured of all my faintings and weakness (which did so

         dear father's will, which was not compromised until
            after my mother's death. <span class="event" id="ev138a-start">And she — having given
            me by her last will and testament and her deeds,
            all her estate (real and personal) except what
            she had excepted in her will — appointed that
            her goods should be removed with what convenient
            speed might be (in regard that my brother, Christopher Wandesford,
            was not willing I should enjoy her estate according
            to her disposal).</span>

            Nor was he willing I should stay in her house
            at Hipswell until I was delivered (having some ill
            persons that put him upon very unjust ways
            with his friends) but, by the good providence of God
            to me, he raised me up my dear aunt Norton and
            uncle, who took me into their house and many of
            my dear mother's goods and my own
              being all preserved.</span>
            
             And

            the will proved and done according to law by the order
            of her executors (my uncle Frescheville, her only
            brother by the mother's side, and my uncle Francis Darley , my husband's uncle) which two friends
            did take care of me, and my dear children after
            my dear mother's decease, and order all her goods

         to several places for security until I was in a
            condition to go to Mr Thornton's country, which
            could not be done until it pleased God I was delivered.

            But, after my dear mother's will was proved
            and put on the file, it behoved us to be careful to
            prevent any tricks about — because of the matters
            which fell out concerning my honoured father's —
            so that the master of the court had orders from
            the executors not to be put on the file until some
            affairs was done (which concerned the said will)
            but to preserve it in safe custody until further order.
         
            My brother, Christopher Wandesford (who had given notice
            to his steward, Robert Loftus, that his mother's goods
            should not be removed out of the house until heard
            from him) was very strict in search of the will
            at London to see how she had disposed of her
            estate. Though what she had of her widowed estate
            at Hipswell was very fair — but nothing to his
            which he enjoyed of my father's in Ireland and in
            England — yet he was in expectancy to have
            got all her personal estate she left, and not satisfied with the £4000 a year left him
            by my father but aimed to have got that of his
               good mother's which, she out of her great kindness
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.171&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 171</a>





         

            and affection, she had bestowed upon me (as she is
            pleased to mention in her deeds and will, with a singular
            character of my duty and obedience to her as well as
            on her deathbed, which is great matter of comfort to me:
            to have the testimony of so pious and holy a parent
            being the motive to induce her to dispose of her
            estate towards my relief and my children's).
         
            After he had caused the court to be searched for
            probate of wills at London — I, being then removed
            to St Nicholas — he told me that he had made a search
            at London where the wills are proved and there was
            no will on the file, and the men of the court said they
            never saw any. And, if so, he believed my mother did
            make no will or disposal of her estate, it did all 
            fall upon him as her heir.
         
            This did much surprise me to hear my only brother,
            formerly pretended so great an affection to me, now
            to seek to defraud me of my dear mother's blessing, et cetera.
         
            I told him that though he was now the heir, as being a
            son, yet I was two years elder by my birth and, though he had
            got the birth right, yet I ought to have a share of her
            blessing if she had not made a will. But God be praised,
            she had made one in perfect form and manner and deed,

            by which she disposed all as she thought fit, and
            the will was at London long since and proved fully,
            and he might repair to it, if he pleased, and be satisfied.
         
            He did not believe me then, but since that did
            find the will on the file and so received satisfaction
            how she had ordered all her estate.</span>
           
           
           
            Which, since I am speaking of it, may not be amiss to acknowledge God's great goodness and
            mercies to myself, and my dear husband and children,
            in those provisions she made for us in her
           
           will and deeds, <span class="event" id="ev140-start">besides her excellent kindness
            she expressed to us in giving my husband, myself and all my family: one man, and three maids
            and nurses; and all the occasions of my sicknesses,
            christenings and deaths of my children;
         
             all our table gratis, with all necessaries of house
            (bedding, linen, furniture, coals, hay, corn, et cetera).
           
            And this continued for above eight years
            after I was married. As long as she lived, with a
            great deal of hearty love and freedom, did this
              dear saint of God entertain us,
         
            which constant housekeeping for our particulars,
            besides her own, she did account it stood her in
            above the sum of £200 a year.</span>

         Which she has told me, if she had not done, she
            might have given me £1600
            more in money which would have purchased land.
            Added to that, her land at Middleham which cost her
            £550 or £560.
         
            As to her personal estate in moneys,
            plate, linen, bedding, et cetera, I have heard Mr
            Thornton say he had as good of what my dear
               mother left me to the value of £1000 more, which amounts to the value
            in money from my mother received by Mr Thornton
            and myself and children, £2550 or £2600.

            Besides which she made a deed of gift to 
            feoffees
             in trust of all her arrears in Ireland due
            to her out of my father's estate of Idough of £300
              per annum, in lieu of her jointure. She, outliving
            my dear father 19 years, there became due to her,

            my father's estate) and ought to be paid me by her
            will. But I know, in all these things, my poor brother

            I have all the reason in the world not to conceal the great goodness of my gracious
            God  
             in due
            acknowledgement, humble gratitude to his
            divine majesty, who raised and preserved this

            who gave me all my maintenance as well as
            to my three brothers during our minorities
            which should have been done out of Kirklington.
           
            But she has given it in, on account, that she
            had expended upon our three persons (myself
            and two younger brothers, Christopher and John Wandesford
              and myself) to the sum of £1500 in maintenance

            given it to me and my children, and husband.
           
            But since that was not paid to her, yet did
            she express her bounty in what she was able to me.

            when my husband and I was in bed. At our bed-feet,
            the said trunk stood which I, afterwards, took and
            disposed of much of it for to furnish Mr Thornton's house
            and to pay Nettleton's bailiffs, and other necessaries to his
            use, as I can show an account.
         
            Besides, there was a great sum of money
            (that was of her arrears of rents received at
            Hipswell tenants) which was disbursed by me for
            his use in accounts for housekeeping as may appear,

            charges out of that particular land, and let at £28 year,
         
          it will amount

             fetching the afterbirth, and for half an hour
            I was in such extremity while she did fetch it

            was baptised by Mr Kearton of Richmond, called
             after his father's name, William. His sureties were
            my cousin John Yorke, cousin William Norton and
            my cousin James Darcy's Lady of Richmond.</span>
          
         
            
            Thus, was I blessed with the life and comfort of my
            dear child's baptism, with its enjoyment of the holy
            seal of regeneration, and <span class="event" id="ev148-start">my sweet babe was in
            good health to whom I gave suck, my good <span class="evquote">God
            having given me the blessings of the breast as of the womb also</span>,
            which was no small comfort to me. And the joy of it
            maked me recruit faster for his sake, that I might do
            my duty to him as a mother and that a great satisfaction to
            my weak heart while I enjoyed his life.</span>
         
            But it so pleased God to shorten this joy, lest
            I should be too much, or my husband, transported
            with that comfort we hoped to have had in his continuance.
          <span class="event" id="ev149-start">
            And I was visited with another trial; for, on the Friday
               sennight after his birth, he began to be very angry
            and froward and fretting, so that I gave him a little Gascon's
            powder and cordial — lest it should be the red gum in
            children usual at that time — to strike it out of his
            heart at morning after his dressing.

          Upon which, he slept three hours very finely and quiet.
            When he wakened, his face was all over full of
             red, round spots (like the smallpox) being
             of the compass of a silver halfpenny and all over-
            whealed white. These continued very full and
             well out, until night being very well and cheerful
            and not fretting as before they came out.
          But then, at night, after he was dressed and laid
             in his night-bed, the nurse using to hold him up
            in her arms in his little shirt and stand a little on
            his legs before she put him into his bed-shirt
             (which she did so that time, not fearing cold, though I did
             forbid her to do it). But as soon as he was dressed
             in his night clothes, whether he had got any cold or 
             what was the reason, God knows, 
         
             but all the red spots struck into his face,
            and he grew pale and was very sick and groaned
            all that night much. And when I tried him oft
            to suck, he could not, but let my breast fall
            out of his mouth and, being on a slumber in my arms
            on my knee, he would sweetly lift up his eyes
            to heaven and smile, as if the old saying was true in
            this sweet infant: that he saw angels in heaven.
         
            But his sweet breath grew weaker of a sudden,
            and I did fear the Lord would take him to himself
            which put me upon the thoughts <span class="evquote">to freely submit
            my will to the will</span> and pleasure of the great God

of heaven, who had given him to me and was now
            taking his sweet soul away from me. And with
            all the powers of my soul, I endeavoured to bear it with
            patience and to deliver him up into the hand of my holy
            Father, which is in heaven, saying <span class="evquote">the Lord gives and the
            Lord takes, blessed be the name of the Lord</span>.
         
            We gave this dear saint of God what cordials
            we could but all in vain;</span> <span class="event" id="ev149a-start">for it was the Lord's will
            to take his soul from him, my sweet joy, about nine
            o'clock on Saturday morning, to the great discomfit

            poor father who loved and doted upon him.</span>

            a delicate son, who we took delight in. <span class="event" id="ev151-start">My Lady
               Frances Darcy, coming to see me, desired me to
            bear it as patiently as I could; for she was
            persuaded that God would at length give
            me a son to live (and my husband) but he was to
            be born at his house where God would make him
            the heir of, and the Lord would look in mercy
            
            
            upon me and that I should not die without an heir.</span>
         
            I was then resolved in my mind, if it should
            please the Lord to grant me that blessing — of
            a son to be an upholder of my husband's
            family in its name — that <span class="quote">I would freely give

many sad thoughts of God's afflicting hand on
            me, and one day was weeping much about it.
            My dear Nally came to me then, being about
            four years old, and looked very seriously on me, said: 
         
             'My dear mother, why do you mourn and 
            weep so much for my brother, Willy? Do you
            not think he is gone to heaven?' I said 'Yes,
            dear heart, I believe he is gone to heaven, but
            your father is so afflicted for his loss, and being a
            son, he takes it more heavily because I have
            not a son to live'.
         
            She said again, 'Mother, would you or my
               father have my brother to live with you, when
            as God has taken him to himself to heaven where
            he has no sickness but lives in happiness? Would
            you have him out of heaven again, where he is
            in joy and happiness? Dear mother, be patient and
            God can give you another son to live with you
            and my father, for my brother is in happiness with 
            God in heaven'. At which, the child's speech, I did
            much condemn myself (being instructed by
            the mouth of one of my own children) and begged
            that the Lord would give me patience and satisfaction
            in his gracious goodness, which had put such words into the mouth of so young a child to reprove my
            immoderate sorrow for him and begged his life might be

            That day on which there was a great deal of joy
            and mirth upon the King Charles II his birth and
            return from his banishment into England and
            his coronation, being matter of great and excellent
            gratitude to heaven to the Church of England,
         
            they had a show at Richmond of all kinds
            of sports and country expressions of joy, and amongst
            the rest they shot off muskets and had soldiers and the
            townsmen of Richmond appeared in armour.
         The maids at St Nicholas did beg leave to 
            go and see the show and would not be pleased until
            I let my dear Nally go with them, but I refused
            and thought it would fright her and do her hurt.
         
          But they got Mr Thornton persuaded and my 
             aunt to let her go and they would take great care
             of her, but was still very unwilling, nor could be
            convinced of the fitness, though they went and carried her
             with them (against my mind) having Mr Thornton's consent.
          But before two hours, they returned with my child,
             home in a very sad and changed condition; for, alas,
            she never having had seen any such things as soldiers

or guns or drums, or noises and shoutings, she was
             so extremely scared at these things, and when
            the muskets went off so fast did so affright
             her and terrify my poor child that she was
             ready to fly out of Jane Flower's arms (her maid). 
          
             And, being almost out of her poor wit,
            did skrike and cry so extremely she could not be
            pacified for all they could do. But, in extremity,
            
            
            fell into most dreadful fits of convulsions there,
            while she was at Richmond, in Mr Smithson's shop;
         
            having had three or four of them, so sadly and
            so dreadfully, that they had much to do to save
            her alive, or bring her to herself again, but started
            extremely much and then falling down again.
         
            At last, they — doing all could do to her — did
            bring my dear child half dead to me, which
            was a sad and dismal affliction to my weak heart,
            and she continued very ill all that night.
         
            But I gave her all medicines for it, and oil
            of amber and peony and other things which, by the Lord's
            great and infinite mercy to me, did at length
            preserve and restore her from them.</span>

            to thee the <span class="quote">God of heaven and earth</span> which hast delivered
            my sweet infant and spared her life again. <span class="quote">Oh, bless

            After dinner, we were in my chamber at my
               aunt Norton's house (St Nicholas) and my dear
                  Katy was playing under the table with her sister,
            being about three years old but a very brave, strong
            child and full of mettle, being much stronger
            than her poor sister, Nally. She never having
            had either rickets nor convulsion fits to keep 
            her down, but always continued very healthful
            and strong, and full of tricks and, indeed, apt to fall into
            dangers. As she was playing with pins and putting them
            into her mouth, her sister saw her, and cried out for
            fear she should do herself hurt.
         
            But she would not be counselled with her and,
            at last, she got a pin across her throat, at which her
               sister cried out that she had got a pin in her throat, 
            and by God's pleasure, I was just near her and catched
            her up in my arms and put my finger immediately
            into her throat. And the pin was cross, and I had much to do
            to get it out but, with all the force I had, it pleased God
            to strengthen me to do it. I got beyond the pin and so
            got it out of her throat, but in a great deal of danger:
            her life was well-nigh gone and she was as black as cold.

She was as black, and the blood set in her face with it,

            death which, if it could have been finished afore,

she would gladly have lived with us. But it was
            not begun soon enough for that purpose.</span><span class="event" id="ev157-start">
         
            I, in this time, while we were at Oswaldkirk,
            my brother Denton preached with much zeal
            and gravity, being indeed a very wise and good
            man from whom our family received much
            assistance, and good advice to Mr Thornton in
            point of contrivance of his house at Newton;
            </span><span class="event" id="ev157a-start">
            for Mr Thornton did not care to trouble himself with those concerns, being naturally addicted
            
            to melancholy humour which had seized on him
            by fits for several years before he was 20
            years old.
         
            Notwithstanding, after the use of great
            means by God's blessing,
             and leeches and other things
            by Dr Wittie's order, ever since we were married
            those fits did much abate, and he was often in a 
            more cheerful temper since, as his friends did
            acknowledge to my great satisfaction.</span>
          
          And when he was in health, he took great pleasure in his house which he did put upon my brother
            Denton's and my care to contrive as was most convenient to his purpose.

            In this time, while I was at Oswaldkirk
            on Shrove

         when it was a great frost and extreme cold
            and snow. And, sitting low down in my brother's
            pew, I felt myself exceeding cold and very
            chill and shaking by fits, and so continued
            very ill until Tuesday after.</span>

            I began a most dangerous sickness which brought
            me to death's door at Oswaldkirk; after my dear
               mother's death and my coming from my own
            country, this was my first entertainment, which I
            got upon a cold I got and aguish temper on the
            Sunday in the church when I felt the sting of that
            distemper and pains creeping into my back as I sat.
         
            But this distemper came most violently
            upon me on Tuesday the 13th of February 1661,
            at which time I began with extreme vomiting
            and pains in my head and back and knees (and,
            indeed, all over my body) in great extremities,
            so that it continued in this manner, with burnings
            and fiery drought (and vomiting all that ever I took for
            any manner of sustenance for five or six days before
            the doctor was sent for) until my mass of blood was

         all infected with that dreadful fever which came
            upon me. And none did hope for this poor life to
            have continued, so that my dear husband
            did send for Dr Wittie to me (I, being in so
            desperate a condition).
         
            When the doctor came, I was almost spent
            and weakened beyond measure by the violence
            of the fever and extreme pains and grievous vomitings; all I took, without sleep, ease or any
            mitigation of the hand of God upon me.
         
            
               The doctor was extreme angry that he was
            not sent for sooner until I was at the last cast.
            All he could do would not stay the vomiting
            though the fever was somewhat abated, I bless
            God, upon letting blood which I much desired.
         
            But, being so far gone, and the fever was a
            putrid, corrupted fever — having not had the
            benefit of nature by siege of eight days,
            and those natural way also for two months
            or thereabouts — my blood was in a great distemper  and out of order.
         
            
               The doctor did confidently assure me that
            I was conceived with child but could not be
            able to go on. He doubted but should miscarry
            because of my vomiting all foods and medicines,
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.195&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 195</a>





         

         which did strain all the ligaments of my body
            and made it impossible I should retain the conception.
            Nor did any manner of food stay with me, until I
            told the doctor that I did extremely thirst after some
            cold water, which he gave me and did more refresh my
            thirsty soul than all which art could give.
         
            That night, being the 17th of February, I did verily
            believe should be my last in this world, being reduced
            
            into such feebleness and weakness of body and spirits.
         
            But, most of all, cast into a spiritual desertion
            from God (which was not to be endured without sinking
            under it by the divine pressures of his displeasure)
            which I apprehended, in this my weakness, my eternal
            state to be in a lost condition by reason of my sins
            and the suggestion of Satan (accusing me falsely
            from my sorrows and temporal afflictions, and casting
            multitude of doubtings into my heart).
         
            As that, surely I did not belong to God and that I
            was not his servant because he followed me with such
            great crosses and afflictions
             — sickness and loss of children,
            friends and estate, suits and vexations from friends — <span class="evquote">and
            which seemed to be curses rather than such trials which
            he exerciseth his children withal</span>.
         
            And that I <span class="evquote">had neglected those offers and tenders of
            mercies in his word and Sacrament which he, from time to
            time, had given</span>

             me from my youth up: in the examples,
            instructions, admonitions of my dear parents
            and his ministers, and his deliverances, checks and calls
            of his spirit with all those spiritual and temporal
            advantages I have had and now want, and had
            no opportunity of receiving the Sacrament
            (being taken from me). All these I did receive
            
             before
            wonderfully, with deliverances of all   
             kinds,
            yet did they not work a thorough conversion
            and change of heart in me to walk according to
            the motions of God's spirit with that strictness of
            I ought to have done.
         
            <span class="evquote">And though I had been kept from falling into
            any enormous sins, yet — for the least omission
            of duties and neglect of his commands, or small
            offences against God or man — eternal damnation was due from so just a God for the breach
            of the least of his commandments</span>.
         
            And that now it was too late to repent
            or hope because I had neglected or driven it off
            so long that my life was at an end; for ought I
            knew, this was my last summons. And that though
            God was able to have mercy on me, yet I had so
            often broke my promises and forgetfulness of God
            that he would not have mercy on me at the
            last hour, as Satan's strong suggestions

would have persuaded me, and pressed upon me
            in my weakness (with many arguments) that it was
            too late and that God would not have mercy on me.
         
            In this most dolorous condition, I continued
            all that night and not hope or expect relief from my
            great unworthiness and ingratitude, expressing
            this — my lamentable condition — in pathetic groans
            which is more fully enlarged in my 'First Book' (in
               pages 189, 190, 191, 192, 193).
         
            Until, when I was almost breathless in my
            soul and got no mercy, nor durst not pray for it,
            <span class="evquote">yet I cast myself down at the footstool of
            grace before the Lord</span>, and said: <span class="evquote">if I perish</span>, I will fly
            unto him alone, <span class="evquote">let him do what seemeth
               
            him good</span>.
            When, immediately, when I was without hopes,
            behold the goodness
             of the Lord to make it appear
            that <span class="evquote">Satan is a liar</span> and that he will show mercy at all
            times, when he please, and to all that call on him.
         
            It pleased him in a most wonderful and gracious
            manner, when I was out of all hopes by reason of the
            strong temptations and my weakness, to bring me a
            speedy help and make me obtain mercy and comfort
            from that most sweet and blessed portion of holy
            scripture, which my dear Lord and saviour spake to
            us by his word, out of St Matthew 11:  28-30.

<span class="evquote">Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy
   laden, and I will give you ease</span>, et cetera. 
          
            Which words was so piercing, like lightning
            into the dark corners
            of my woeful heart, and
            dispelled all the mists of hell and Satan — that he had
            raised in me to make me despair — and was so great
            joy to my soul which even brought me into an ecstasy beyond myself. Not desiring nor wishing to
            live any longer in this wretched life, but since
            I hoped my God was reconciled to my soul, <span class="evquote">I desired to be dissolved and to be with Christ Jesus</span>,
             my Lord and saviour, 
         
             who had now put Satan to flight that would
            have devoured my soul, and I still depended on
            him, and my soul rested on him and was again comforted against all my spiritual enemies. The deep
            consideration of this miraculous deliverances,
            Lord, let me never forget which called upon me
            in my distress when I could not come unto thee.
          
             I have written a whole paper book
             upon
            this great deliverance of my soul and in expressions
            
             of my humble gratitude, as also in the 'First Book'
                meditations here upon in page 192, 193.
         
            And, after these miraculous mercies, I recovered
            my health and strength daily and was very strong
            and healthy within two months or nine weeks. <span class="evquote">Praised be the Lord</span>.

            After this inestimable and wonderful mercies
            and deliverances of my soul from perishing by
            despair and the instigations of our old enemy, Satan,
            and by the gracious influences of God's spirit in my
            satisfaction of all my fears and doubts, and putting
            to flight <span class="evquote">the old serpent</span> (to flight) from doing
            more mischief to my poor soul than the scaring
            me into the firmer and deeper assurances, that
            God (whom I feared and served in the best measure I
            could and with an unfeigned and sincere heart) was of so
            infinite goodness, I was bound to believe his Holy
            Spirit in his word that, <span class="evquote">at what time soever
            a sinner repenteth him of his sins from the bottom
            of his heart, he will put away all his wickedness
            out of his remembrance, saith the Lord</span>.
         
            Which, at this time of visitation, has given me a
            great experience of being graciously pleased to
             suffer my soul to receive comfort — and <span class="evquote">lifted up
            the light of his countenance upon me</span>, and making
            me to receive a great and abundant share of the
            peace of conscience and joy in his salvation — with refreshing of my spirit by the testimony of his love in this
            blessed call of my saviour, in the time of my distress
            (<span class="evquote">Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief</span>) so that I was
            more exceedingly desirous to die than to <span class="evquote">live in this
            vale of misery, sin and death</span>, if the Lord should 
            see it fit for me.

            But behold, with admiration at the infinite and
            transcendent goodness, mercy and power of my gracious God , and in Jesus Christ, the <span class="evquote">Father of mercies</span>
            to us wretched creatures, <span class="evquote">dust and ashes</span>.
         For when I only begged spiritual and the
            Lord gave to me great and abundant addition
            of temporal mercies, filling my soul and heart
            and mouth with abundant praise and gladness.
         
            When I looked for nothing but death and hell
            and destruction, then did our gracious <span class="evquote">Father
            of mercies</span> <span class="evquote">make himself known to be a reconciled God, and not a God that taketh vengeance
            willingly on frail sinners but — in and through Jesus,
            his son</span> — is pleased to accept of our weak endeavours and repentance when we turn to him with
            our whole hearts; yea, in and by the satisfaction and
            merits of the bloodshedding of his son, <span class="evquote">who did
            suffer for sin and sinned not</span>, and made on his cross
            a full satisfaction to his holy Father for the sins
            of the world to reconcile us unto God.
          And thus, in a most gracious measure, showing us that the mercies of the eternal God are not
             to be measured or comprehended by the weak, frail
            apprehensions of mortal creatures. But to be 
            admired and adored, and believed and feared in all his
            works, his goodness, his free grace, his mercy

         and bounty, long-suffering, patience and wisdom
             showed towards us, poor and sinful mortals.
         
            Therefore, will I forever bless and praise, and honour
            and magnify, his riches of his grace and favour to me, his
            weak creature, forever: <span class="evquote">who has not cast me away
            in this distress but healed, helped and delivered me from
            sin of despair and casting away my hope in his mercies</span>.
          For as is his majesty, so is his mercy;
           appointing means, blessed the same to me, so that by
             degrees I was strengthened to admiration: for none that
            ever saw me but judged it impossible that I could
             live. Yet, I was much recruited in my body and comforted in my spirit. Glory be to the name of my God,
             who had compassion and pity on me, a fatherless orphan.</span><span class="event" id="ev160-start">
         
            Although I was not perfectly recovered strength in a
            quarter of a year, being brought so weak in my 
             sickness and extremities in soul and body, 
         
             but about a quarter of a year after, I found
            myself with quick child,
               
             which was so great a
            miracle to believe that I could not be convinced
            of a long time, until, by undeniable signs and tokens,
            it was confirmed. Which was so great and admirable a miracle and a blessing beyond all hopes to the
            doctor as well as ourselves, which could not be apprehended
            after so great and dangerous and desperate sickness,
            wherein Dr Wittie did believe it was impossible that

             I could retain the conception after
            those violencies and extremities of vomitings
            and torments I endured, which loosened the womb
            so extremely that he expected daily and
            looked for a miscarriage. Therefore, did not give
            me nothing as plasters and to prevent it because he thought it better not to proceed too
            far and less danger of my life, which he scarce
            
            hoped for very often.</span>
          
         
            But, O thou, most powerful, most mighty,

            glorious presence, who hath been so vile and
            <span class="quote">unprofitable a servant</span>, and provoked thy judgements to come down upon my head and to

            being so impure in thy eyes, and confess myself
            unworthy to live, move or breathe, or to receive
            such things and miracles of mercies to my poor
            soul and body.
         
            But since, by thy grace and mercy, thou hast
            spared me thus long and <span class="quote">have not given
             me over
            to death and destruction</span>, spiritual and temporal,
            what shall I say to thee, O lover of souls, who has
            not suffered hell and death and Satan to prevail over me,

         but hast had such pity and compassion on
            me, a poor creature, and has delivered me at this
            present from the <span class="quote">jaws of the devil, death</span> and damnation? Oh, great and glorious Lord God, Creator of heaven
            and earth, let not this thy sharp and severe visitation
            be in judgement to my soul, but in mercy to deliver
            and save me, the <span class="quote">handmaid of the Lord</span>, from all his
            destructions he has laid for me. Oh, say unto my

            and thou, O my sweet saviour, did call on me
            to <span class="quote">come unto thee, all ye that are heavy laden
            and labour under sin, and thou would give me

             from the rage of hell and Satan. Let me, I beseech thee,
            ever be under thy wing of providence and guide
            me aright in thy ways that I may never fall into
             temptation of sin, the world or the devil, <span class="quote">who, like
             a roaring lion, would have devoured my soul

             Christ, do not leave us to his fury nor let him
             have power to devour me, thy handmaid and
             servant, who thou hast so wonderfully delivered
             us. But I pray thee, O Lord, to preserve this poor 
                infant still by thy power and providence that
             sin, nor Satan, may never destroy it nor have
             no part in me or my child, who so mightily

             from abortion and destruction by
             this great and dreadful sickness in my womb.
          But, for thy great mercy's sake, deliver still the
             poor mother and her child that she may bring forth, in

thy due time, to perfection that which thy hand
             has made and created in me and my womb; that it may
             be, O Lord, an heir of salvation of what sex soever

    <span class="event" id="ev161-start">
         
            In the midst of my distress of mind in my
            late great sickness, and I saw no hopes of my recovery, 
         
             one great ingredient of my sorrow was for
            the uncertainty I should leave my poor daughters
            in, being but young children then, in regard
            of any settled fortune or provision was then
            left to provide either for their maintenance 
            or portion.
          Because the estate of Burn Park, which
            had been settled for their provision by articles
             made before marriage, was forced by Mr
                Nettleton's debt, for which, upon the assignment
             of Mr Norton to Mr Thornton, he had secured
             to Nettleton out of his own land. And as I have
             related before, I was compelled — to preserve my
            husband from prison — to cut off that entail
            and Mr Thornton did engage before Baron Thorpe
            to settle provisions for my younger children
             (instead of Burn Park was sold for this debt)
          to settle provisions for portions and maintenance for them out of Leysthorpe. I not having
            more alive but these two children, Alice and
            Katherine, which was yet unprovided for at this
            time of my sickness.
         
            The consideration of this — that I might die
            in this sickness before anything done for them
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.207&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 207</a>





         

         by way of provision instead of what was so
            settled for them before marriage, and that it was very
            probable Mr Thornton might marry again and
            then the estate would wholly devolve from my heirs and
             
            
            these my children of my body — was very afflicting
            to my thoughts. And did much press upon me to
            take some advice what to do in this case to have
            some provision made for these my dear, poor,
            young infants, not able to take care for themselves , or the child yet unborn,
            
             nor had I any relation or friend near
            me to take the matter into their cognisance.</span>
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev162-start">
         
            At length, it did, by God's mercy, come into
            my mind to acquaint my cousin Legard (then
            at Sir Henry Cholmley's, the Grange) being a lawyer,
            
            
            he, I desired to read my writings and settlements
            of the whole estate (both as to articles and then
            deeds which ought to have been made punctually
            by them) and to give me his opinion of them, 
         
             whether or not Mr Thornton had power to
            cut off the entail from my children or not.
          </span>
          
          <span class="event" id="ev163-start">
            In regard that, when I was at St Nicholas my
               aunt Norton desired if I had a son, being then
            with child, it might be called Charles, it bringing his
            name with him and coming at so happy a time as at
            the restoration of the king and the church.
         
            But Mr Thornton would not consent to that,
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.208&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 208</a>





         

            to have him called Charles, for reasons best known
          to himself. But told me if I would have him
            called Charles, if it were a son, he should not
            heir any of his land, not a foot of his land,
         
            which did a little trouble me. But said that
            I prayed God to send me well over that condition
            and give him a son, and he might call him what he
            would. And so, God blessing me with a son, he had
            him called after his own name (though I told
            him, if he pleased, not to cross the names of
            his pedigree which had for so many hundred
            years gone in William and Robert).
         
            Yet, this circumstance of his saying, 'if it
            was called Charles, it should not inherit his
            land', put me in mind — in my sickness — that
            he had power to do it and made me to search
            more into the business. For, if I should now
            have had a son, yet it was not secure for
            that, but he might possibly have been cut
            off for a second venture (having power so to do).</span>
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev164-start">
         
            To prevent which, if pleased God and for me to
            do my duty to these daughters and my son — and in hopes of
            a son, being with child — I did advise with Mr Legard.
         
            And, upon reading of the writings, he
            found that Mr Thornton had power by those

            deeds (which was drawn at Chester) to cut off
            the entail of his land from my issue, contrary
            to the articles of my marriage made betwixt my
               dear mother and himself, which thing did much
            trouble me that the writings was drawn so
            contrary to the very intentions and settlements
            upon which a marriage proceeded or else not to have
            been (either
            
            by my mother or myself) consented to.
         
         
            But by this accident was discovered, so that
            I begged my cousin Legard to prevail with
            Mr Thornton in my children's behalf, who was
            then his lawful heirs, that he would make
            some assurance of provision for them for a
            portion. And then, afterwards, if it pleased
            God I should live and have son to settle the land
            according to articles of marriage.
         
            To which my dear husband consented and
            did then enter into a bond of £6000 to secure
            unto the two daughters the sum of each of
            them £1500 apiece (instead of their right otherways) until the estate could be better settled in that
            exigent of my danger of death.
         
            Which bond was in Mr Legard's hand and
            delivered up to Mr Thornton, as I believe, upon the
            provision of settlement of Leysthorpe by Mr
               Covill and that entail.

         There was a paper draft drawn by Mr
            Legard of settlement of Leysthorpe afterward
            (when we were at Newton) and sent by Mr Thornton
            from London which he did give me to read.
            But it was not drawn according to the
            articles of marriage.
          Videlicet. Settled upon my heirs males and, for
             want of such issue, upon my heirs female.
          But first, upon my heirs males and, for
             want of such issue, to Mr Thornton's heirs
             males upon any other wife, as may more appear.
               
            
         
         
            Which paper book
             
            I read, and I did not
            consent unto it (being destructive to the
            heirs of my own body) and desired my
            husband to be more kind to my lawful
            issue, who had brought him a plentiful
            
            fortune, nor could any blame the bowels of
            a mother to grant her own issue to be cut
            out of what they were born to.
         
            I know my poor husband was advised
            to this way to preserve his name but, if God
            had denied sons by me, it was not convenient to make heirs where God would have
            none. As my godfather, Parson Lascelles, told
            my father, when he was going to entail his
            land of some affair of my
               
             kin and disinherit

         his daughters for where God will have a 
            family to continue in the name, he can give them
            sons and not for us to appoint who we will.
         
            So, this affair of making a deed of settlement
            of Leysthorpe was deferred until after I came to my
            house at East Newton, which I must speak further
            of, in its due place.</span>

            of sport and play, did climb into the window

         This Nan Robinson was a servant which
            I had brought from Richmond and St Nicholas
            with me and to whom, as being a servant
             for
            work, I was very kind, as indeed I find myself desirous to be grateful when they deserve
            it (without a boast) for I am glad to meet with any
            who would encourage me by their duty.
          She, living with me in my aunt's house
             at St Nicholas, fell in love with one of her men,
             Normavill Fisher, who was a foolish, young
             boy of 18, but this Nan had so great folly
            that she was bewitched with his person. 
         
             Though he was one that was a bastard and had
            gotten one (as we heard) himself and, therefore, no
            way was he a fit husband for her.
         
            Jane Flower and I, out of our love to this woman,
            did often advise her against him — because
            he was not suitable for her and had no means
            to keep her on — but Nan was so ill displeased
            and angry (secretly, as she confessed to me after)

         at Jane Flower and myself that she was resolved
            to be revenged of us both for speaking to advise
            her against this Fisher.
          
          
    
         
            But this was not discovered until she had
            done us a very wicked displeasure to my
               husband's brother, Mr Thomas Thornton,
            who was a very humorous man and had not
            so good a nature as the rest of my brothers and
             sisters (though he was a very honest, plain man).
         
            It happened that, as my custom was, I did
            invite my brothers and sisters to dine with us on
            a Sunday, but he turned away and would not
            speak to me; at which I wondered, he not doing
            so to me before but was always kind and
            civil to me who, he said, was the best sister he had.
         
            At evening, after prayers, Mr Thornton and myself went down to see my brothers and sisters,
            where we found them altogether sitting at door.
         
            I gave them the usual civility, and they all did
            return it again but my brother, Thomas. I asked
            him, 'Brother, I would have been glad to have
            had your company to dinner today, why would
            you not come?' To which he answered, very doggedly
            and surlily, and said I did not mean as I spake
            and was but a hypocrite. At which, I told him he did
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.214&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 214</a>





         

me much wrong. For I had always the
            desire to speak as I meant, and wondered he
            should say such a thing of me that I did not
            deserve. Upon which, he flung away in a
            great anger against me.
          
            I could not but be extremely grieved and
            moved at his ill carriage towards me and
            fell into a great passion of weeping to find
            myself so highly affronted by my husband's
            brother. And went into the garden to Mr Thornton, 
         
             making my complaint to himself and
            my brother Denton, and related the same thing
            of my brother, Thomas, with great concern for what I
            had ever done or said anything
             to offend him at any time.
         
         
            They both did pray me not to 
            be so troubled
            at him; for he was a very humorous man
            at all his friends, and never was friends with
            them altogether, and I must not be so sore troubled.
            
         
         
            I said I was sure some had been telling of
            lies to him and prayed my brother Denton to
            get it out of him and, if I had really done him
            any injury — which I knew of none — I would
            satisfy him and, if not, he must not continue
            so displeased without a cause.
          After which, my brother Denton examined him
             and found he had been told that I said, 'I 
            had rather have a Scot in Scotland have the
             estate than him',

which words I did utterly deny; for I never
             thought such a thing in my heart, nor could I
             speak it with my mouth but on the contrary (if
             anything were said) and that Mr Thornton knows.
          For when, at any time, my brother Thomas had been
             drinking and tippling, as he was used (God knows)
             too often to do, it did so much grieve my
            husband that one time said to me,
           'Here is this brother, Thomas, doth so grieve
             me and trouble me, with his idle course of life and
             drinking, that he shall never heir any
             land of mine. And I will cut him off and
             give it to Jackey Denton, my sister's son'.
            
          
            At which, I answered, 'Mr Thornton, oh, dear
            heart, do not so; for he is your own brother
            and, though he be not so good as you would have
            him, he is your next heir after your children. 
         
            And God may give him children that may
            be good, for I have seldom seen an estate to
            prosper when the right heirs are cut off'.
         
            And this, my husband did affirm I said
            and desired my brother Denton to get it out of him
            who did tell him that lie of me. Whereupon, he
            examined him again and, with much ado, got it
            out of my brother, Thomas, who did affirm that
            Nan Robinson told him, before she went away.

            A long story of my maid, Jane Flower, and
            myself. Videlicet.
         
            That, one day, I was at Oswaldkirk, and
            (as she said, was not well and she was combing
            my head) that Jane should say to me, 'Now,
            if you should die, God help these two children of
               yours, for Mr Thomas would wrong them of
            the estate', which, Nan said, Jane did repeat
            twice or thrice before I spoke to answer her.
          And, at length, when she had spoke so oft
             to me, Nan said, I answered her that I had
            rather a Scot in Scotland should have it
             than my brother Thomas, which he believed I did
             say because Nan told him she heard it,
           but she charged him not to tell who told
            him.
         
            After my brother Denton rehearsed this
            to me, before Mr Thornton, he said he believed
            she was a great liar for I would not say such
            a word. And I did positively deny the whole
            thing: that Jane never said so to me, nor I to her, and
            I would have it searched out the truth of it.
         
          
    
         
            After a little while, Jane was to go to Allerton
            to see her father and mother, and I bid her to go
            see Nan Robinson at Scruton (within a little of
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.217&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 217</a>





         

            Allerton) and to charge her to tell the truth
            and I would forgive her (if she did tell my brother
            that story) upon her repentance for such a great
            lie she told of us both. But, if she did not confess it, she might never expect any kindness
            from me or her.
         
            Jane did as I had ordered her and took her aside, and betwixt them two, told her to that effect, but
            first asked if she remembered she had ever heard
            such words passed at any time betwixt her mistress
            and herself. To which Nan did protest and swear that
            she never had in all her life heard any such thing.
          Then, she again charged her with telling my
             brother, Thomas, that story. To which, with cursed execrations, she denied utterly and said, would she be
            such a beast as to make such a lie of me who had
             saved her life often and had been a mother to her?
            She would be hanged before she would do such a
            wicked thing, so that Jane did believe her.
         And came and told me all this discourse betwixt
            them, and I related it to my brother Denton, and he did
            tell my brother, Thomas, that Nan denied all and said she did
            never tell him such things of us.
          Upon which, my brother, Thomas, did protest
             and vow that she did tell him every word, as he was a 
             Christian, so that I was assured Nan had made
             that lie of us.

          The occasion of her going away, as she
             pretended, was to recruit her strength after
             a dreadful fit of the running gout, which it
            pleased God to lay upon her after she had
            thus wronged me and my maid.
         
            She had the most grievous torments and
            pains in extremity, all over her joints and
            limbs, and swelling all over them; the pain
            first coming from one hand and fingers and
            from the other, and from one foot and leg to the other
            in a day's time or at nights.
         Which followed so thick upon her that
            she took no rest or sleep, or scarce any meat,
            which we were all in a great confusion for her.
            And I knew not anything too good for her, and did
            watch myself and servants and had others to help
            night and day with her, and used all the means
            and doctor for her I could get. (And her shoutings
            so great and loud that we was forced to lie at
            my brother Denton's and could not sleep for her
            in our own house.)
          After a month's time, and all the means I could
             possibly use to recover her, she was restored and
            free from those pains and was in a very good
             way of mends. But, she had sent for her mother,
            who came and would needs have her home
             (it being agreed betwixt them) and procured a
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.219&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 219</a>





         

             horse-litter to carry her easily, and paid all costs
            and charges of her sickness and all things besides her
             wages all that time and those to do her work, above £5.
         
          Now, while she was with me, Robert Webster
             (Mr Thornton's man) was very fond of her and
             would have had her to his wife. And we all did
             counsel her to forsake Normavill Fisher, that
             never looked at her, and to have Robin Webster.
         
            And I was so kind to her that I told her,
            before Jane and my two children, that if she
            minded what I should say, I would offer her a 
            kindness if she accepted of it that she should
            never have again if she refused.
         
            That because Robin Webster loved her and did
            dote so much on her, he would make her a better
            husband than the other. And, if she could love
            him, I would desire Mr Thornton to build up the  warrenwarant 
            house
             at Newton and they should live in it and
            pay rent, and he might do service to Mr Thornton
            as he had which would do him and her good.
         
            Upon which she thanked me for my kind offer
            but she would never love that man as long as
            she lived, and that she hated him as ill as a todd or
            the devil and wished she might never prosper if
            she had him, and would be drawn in pieces with wild
            horses before she would have him and such like curses.

          Upon which, I bid her hold her tongue for
             a wicked woman that cursed herself so. For
            it would light on her for her wickedness
             and as a curse to her, God would make her
             to be as mad on him as ever any was, and her
            evil would lighton because God sees all her
            ways and words.
          And bid her take notice that what I, in
             kindness, had wished her to and, about building the warren house, I would not do it
             for her (she, having denied my kindness).
          So that, I believe, she had a design to go
             home to see if she could get the other man,
            and when she came home found he was
            married to another woman.
          And after this intrigue was over, and her
             desires crossed of this fellow, she cast about
             in her mind how to lay hold on Robert Webster,
             being advised by her friends perhaps. (He
            having a great deal of money gotten in Mr Thornton's
             service while he was a justice of peace.)
          So, it was concluded she could not get
             him because he had never gone to see her, being
             advised against it by his best friends (she
            being a woman given to drink and that not fit
             to make a wife of, nor indeed did I know of that
             quality until too late to retrieve myself).
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.221&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 221</a>





         

         It was advised she should get into my service
            again, which would compass the business for her.
            So, she got their minister (which I knew) to write a
            most excellent submissive, humble letter with all
            the fair words of gratitude for what I had done and that
            she begged she might be entertained as my servant.
          When I got this letter, I writ word that, before
            she could expect I would entertain her
             again, I would be satisfied of things where
             she had done me wrong. Upon which, she comes
             to Oswaldkirk and, in a most fearful trembling,
             she came into my chamber. I asked her, with a
             troubled heart and charged her home, what that
             lie she told my brother,Thomas, and whether she had ever
             heard Jane and I to speak anything to that purpose.
            
            
             She fell down, amazed, at my chair and said, no,
             she did not, as she hoped to be saved.
         
            I, then, with much grief, told her what made
            her to make such abominable lies to make
            my husband's brother to hate me: how durst
            she do it? To which, she said, with many tears and seeming
            sorrow, that it was the devil that bid her do it
            because she did it to be revenged of Jane and myself for persuading her for her good against
            Normavill Fisher. Thus, was the free and true confession
            of this wretched, vile creature to clear me of that lie
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.222&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 222</a>





         

         which she had invented to be revenged
            of us for our good will to her. And so, when I
            had reproved her severely and caused her to confess it to my brother Denton and brother Thomas Thornton,
            I was so much a fool that — upon her repentance —
            I entertained her again, which act of pity
            I did hoping she would have had more
            grace never to do the like and after my
            saviour's command: if thy brother sin against
            thee and repent, thou shall forgive him. But the
            good Lord, my God, knoweth what an ill
            instrument of hell this has been to me in a more
            bloody and cruel manner to do wickedly
            against me, and sinning against God and her
            own conscience and betraying my innocent
            soul by her pernicious slanders.
          But the Lord, my gracious <span class="evquote">Father of heaven</span>,
             has brought it upon her own head, and made
            her to confess her own guilt and wickedness
             before my brother Denton and my children, and to do
             me that right to say, it was the devil that put
             it upon her again.</span>
          
          So that he is the father of lies, and of him this
            wretched creature takes counsel to destroy
             me, the poor <span class="quote">handmaid of the Lord</span>. O Lord,
             I beseech thy gracious mercy to <span class="quote">deliver me from

          me to overthrow my soul, and to
             destroy my comfort of my Life. Oh, do thou, O
             Lord, save and defend me from perishing by them,
             for <span class="quote">I put my whole trust in thee</span>, O God, my
             guide, my judge and my redeemer.
         And be thou not merciful to those that offend
            of malicious wickedness.
          For thou, <span class="quote">O Lord, most high</span>, hast seen my
            great affliction and pitied me in my deep consternation  and distress upon this, their great
            wickedness, and didst deliver my soul from their
            deep laid plots against my life, and has now
            raised up my dear brother Denton to be my
            comfort and friend in these deep distresses and to be a
             witness — with my children and servants — of my wronged
             innocency, and caused their own tongues to accuse
             themselves. <span class="quote">I will bless and praise the Lord <span class="quote">God of my
            salvation</span> from henceforth and

         It pleased our gracious God, after many difficulties
            and dangers, sicknesses and troubles, and after six years 
            work at the dwelling house of Mr Thornton (having
            builded it from the ground) the Lord gave us all leave —
          with our family and my two daughters, Alice
            and Katherine — to come to live at it, being so much
            ready as to fit us to dwell in it, this 10th of June
               1662.
          I, being then big with that child, of whom I had
             so many and great deliverances of sickness and sorrows,
             griefs and frights which befell me at Oswaldkirk (related).
          Yet, such was the abundant and exceeding mercies
             of my heavenly Father to me, his poor servant, that
            he enabled me with a great deal of strength and vigour
             (being great with child) to walk from Oswaldkirk,
             with my dear husband and all our company, to Newton.
          
          For which excellent mercies to me, his poor handmaid,
            I do offer most humble and faithful thanks and praises
             to the great God of heaven, for enabling me with strength
            to do this great thing and do glorify his holy name for
             this, <span class="evquote">his mercies endureth forever</span>.

          Also, he did give me a comfortable settlement in
             this, our house, that he gave us to build up, when the old
            house could not stand longer for age and the
            antiquity thereof, which blessing was given to my dear
            husband and myself to rebuild so ancient a 
             seat more than to many of his forefathers.
          Oh, that we may walk in all faithfulness
             and holiness before his face, according to his rich and
            bountiful grace conferred on my dear husband
            and myself, and not only we but our posterity after us

            Blessed be the glorious name of our God also who
            gave me a comfortable settlement at our own house,
            which I got furnished with what my dear mother
            did give me (other goods) within five days' time,
            having got all things ready before I came into it
            for setting up. And with part of my dear mother's money 
         
             also, I got all the grounds in his hand stocked with
            his cattle in that time when we came into it.</span><span class="event" id="ev172a-start">
         
            After which of our coming to the house, within a little
            time, my dear husband was called to London about
             that unfortunate business of Mr Nettleton, as before related. He, going purposely for that affair to prevent
            the breaking up of an execution against him by Mr
               Nettleton, for a debt which Mr Thornton had secured out of
             his estate, and it ought to have been paid out of the lease for
            41 years out of my father's land in Ireland, as before said.

             (As more at large may appear in my 'First Book' in
   pages 194, 195, 196, with all circumstances about this affair.)
         
            But, before I came from Oswaldkirk, having
            fears upon me that Mr Thornton might have some
            false dealing done to him — and that there was but
            100<am xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">d</am> betwixt them — I did desire him to take it up and
            pay him, rather than have suits run on and prosecuted 
            
            to the far end.
         
            But Mr Thornton would not do it, but thought to have
            got better of him and made him refund £100. I did
            also offer to procure as much for him (having as
            much of my own, which my dear mother gave me) but
            Mr Thornton hoped to save it and so went to London
            on purpose to prevent the breaking up the execution.</span><span class="event" id="ev172b-start">
         
            But he prosecuted him with all the rigour could be, and
            false dealing and treachery, against Mr Thornton. And,
            most unjustly and spitefully, watched an opportunity when
            Mr Thornton was at London to have prevented Nettleton
            got an execution broken up (against body, lands
            and goods, having entered into a statute to him) 
         
             and one morning, very early, came with his own
               man and four other bailiffs to seize upon all the goods, plate,
            monies, whatever else we had in the world, until they
            were all paid their demand and satisfied their debt, et cetera.
         
            At first, the men was very rude and violent: I
            feared they would have seized upon my person (then
            big with child) but they frighted me very sore.

            But behold the great goodness of my gracious
            Father in heaven, who had provided some of my
               husband's friends. My good brother Denton, who with
            his prudence did mitigate their fury, and although they
            demanded at first the whole sum of £800 to be
            forthwith paid to them (for which the statute
               
            
            was entered).
         
         
            But he, knowing the debt was all paid, only part 
            of it in dispute, prevailed with them to take the
            sum of £200,
             which they
             would have paid or else to
             seize on all the plate and what I had in the house,
            and all quick goods, horses and all else, et cetera.
         
            I confess this accident was very afflicting to me,
            both in regard it was a debt of my father's and ought
            to have been paid out of his estate (and would have been
            so had not Mr Thornton been ill advised — and wronged in it — to
            secure it out of his own, contrary to reason or need for 
            there was £2000
             a year to pay it out of my father's land
            
            in Ireland).
         
            And besides it was a great disparagement that
            when we were new come into the house — where we
            were to live in reputation as family, and I brought
            a good fortune to my husband and clear as any was
            by father and mother — yet such a misfortune to happen
            to entertain my first coming into the world was
            very unhappy and uncomfortable to me.

            Besides, the great and suddenness of the terror and affright
            this action brought me into in my condition (having
            but lately escaped death and miscarriage so nearly two times)
            
            
            and this fright, joined with a hearty grief, did bring me
            very low again and I expected nothing but a sudden
            abortion and destruction of my poor infant in my
            womb. It had been happy if my dear husband
            would have hearkened to my kind and affectionate
            advice to have agreed with his adversary: he had
            gone to London and he should freely have had my own
            money (that my dear mother had given me to furnish
            my house) and have prevented all this mischief that
            befell to me and might have done worse.</span>
       
          
            But still, in all accidents, whatever befalls me
            in this or other concerns of my life, the Lord, my 
            God, who is my only life and support, preserver and deliverer  doth still show his most gracious, and mighty
            hand of providence over me, and my poor, innocent
            infant in me to deliver and preserve us from utter
            destruction even in this sad exigent and calamity, 
         
             and appointed a relief at hand for me to prevent
            the most dreadful consequences that might have
            fallen upon us. Oh, blessed be the glorious name of my
            God and saviour forever, for his goodness to me and my poor
               child in my womb (who was designed to have been destroyed by Satan and his persecutions against me
            because I have resolved to serve my God in all things).

    <span class="event" id="ev173-start">  
         
            In the first place, I am to consider with humble
            gratitude to his majesty that, though it was but in
            a dream, he gave me so much warning of this
            evil to happen upon me, which did prepare me with
            more patience for this accident which was to come on
            me that day. By which means I was not so extreme, suddenly surprised as otherwise I should have
            been which might have, without it, been fatal to us
            both (mother and the child).
         
            
         
            For that very morning, before the bailiffs came,
            I dreamed for a certain that Nettleton had sent
            his bailiffs to drive all our goods and to seize on all
            we had for that debt which Mr Thornton engaged.
         
            And I was in deep concern as soon as I
            wakened out of sleep after it, but case that he
            should send to distrain upon me in Mr Thornton's
            absence, what could I do in it and how could
            I be preserved? It might not be impossible, I thought,
            such a thing should (though he went up to London
            to hinder it) but, however, I was glad that he was not
            at home though they would be rude with all.
          When I was in these thoughts in my mind, at
             that very tonune of time, came my maid Jane
            Flower to my chamber door and unlocked it very softly
             and came so to the bedside, and — with a soft voice, for fear
             of frighting me out of my sleep if she spoke suddenly — 
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.235&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 235</a>





         
          
             spoke softly to me, 'Forsooth, are you awake or a sleep?'
             I immediately answered her, 'Jane, I am awake but,
             pray answer me truly to what I ask you. is Nettleton's
             bailiffs here?' At which she was surprised, and said, 'Has
             anybody been here with you today, to tell you so?' I said,
             'No, nobody. Did you not lock me in? 
          
              But tell me truly, are they not below?' To which she said,
            'Yes, indeed', they were below, 'but how, in God's name, did
            you know?' I said, 'None but my God gave me warning in
            a dream, which I had dreamt this morning'. She prayed me,
            for God's sake, not to be afraid, for they should not come
            to me, and they would take what care they could to make
            them quit (for there was Mr Denton and Mr Darley with them).
          
         
            So, I blessed God for giving me this notice beforehand,
            which did me much good and prevented the extremity of
            the fright to fall on my poor spirits,</span> though with much grief
            that fall on me and fright too; <span class="event" id="ev174-start">for the rudeness of those men
             and considering the injustice and unhandsomeness of that concern
            that came suddenly on me in that business.
          
    
         
            Yet, behold, and see the good providence of God still
            to take care of me that I should not be hurt or too much
            
            disgraced in this country, being a stranger, but had so
            ordered it that there was £100 of my portion newly
            come into the house (which Mr Thornton had lent to Mr Darley
            and paid back again) which £100,
             together with £57 of my
            own which my blessed mother had given me by Daphne before
            her death.

            which did at present satisfy them (upon my uncle
            Francis Darley's promise to make it up £200 or else
            their fury would not have been stopped without a further
            mischief and taken my poor bed, and my children's, with what
            we had given by her for our relief).</span>
          
         
            Thus was the exceeding mercy and goodness of the
            Lord extended towards me and my husband and child 
            at this time, <span class="quote">in my deep distress. I called upon my
            God, and he heard me, and did deliver me and mine</span>. Oh, that
            my mouth and heart, and <span class="quote">all that is within me, may bless
            and praise and glorify his glorious name</span>, who sent me
            relief out of my own by his good providence
            at this time also, and prevented all ill accidents to
            the worst that might befall me. <span class="quote">Bless the Lord, O my poor
            soul, and all that is within me for evermore</span>.
         
            Oh, let myself and poor infant live to thy glory.

         Upon my first coming to live at the new
            house at Newton in the months of June and July,
            before Mr Thornton's return from London or that
            Nettleton's bailiffs made this disturbance,
          it was matter of some comfort to me that
            all the best of the gentry and neighbourhood showed
            so great a respect and kindness to me in their regard for the family and my husband.
         
            Who, in his absence, made their several visits
            to me; although but a stranger amongst them, yet did
            they all come to drink with me in my new house (as
            they said) being glad that Mr Thornton did come 
            and settle amongst them and had a good wife to uphold the house.
         
         
            I gave them — in their several qualities and degrees —
            the best welcome I could, bid them all very welcome
            as I could in my husband's absence, who I am sorry
            that he was not here to do it, but told them I took
            it extreme kindly from them to give me this encouragement
            to come amongst such good neighbours. And did assure them
            I would endeavour to return their respects with the best
            service I could to be a good neighbour to them and do what
            good I could to them all. They all answered very kind and
            affectionately, and I believe that day my brother Denton and
            my sisters came, I had at least 50 or 60 people with
            them which did much comfort me in these respects for me.
            </span>
            And oh, bless God for these mercies towards me.

            (sickness, dangers and ill accidents) and to make me
            draw near to the time of my delivery,
          having prepared myself in the best manner
            I could — in the receiving the most Holy Sacrament
            and other preparations — for so solemn a change
            for what belong to my spiritual concerns.
         
            And now it is my duty also, as a Christian
            and one whom the Lord had vouchsafed
             to make
            a mother of a family, to take more near care
            of them (who, for aught I know, I might leave
            behind me in this world) and therefore, ought,
            as much as in me laid, to have them provided
            for according to the true intent of all parties
            agreed upon before that consent of marriage
            was had (either from myself or dear mother).

            And to that purpose,
            the articles which was drawn
            by Mr Thornton himself and writ by him, and that
            done also according to the example of his own

            These was to be the rule for us to proceed by
            (which, if they had been done by us from the first draft
            of settlement, there had been no occasion now
            to have been altered, being done by the form of those articles).
         
         
            But that 
            deed not being so done to satisfaction,
            but liberty left in my first jointure settlement
            by Sir Robert Barwick, uncle Darley's lawyer (which,
            my dear mother not suspecting anything,
            was not aware of it, nor did intend such
            liberty to be left to cut off the entail from my
            issue, but to have been done as by the articles of
            marriage: upon my issue without recall).
         
            Which power I knew not of until that passage
            at St Nicholas, related before, which made me to give
            the said deeds to be viewed by Mr Legard
            and to get — for that present necessity — that bond of
            £1000 to assure something certain to the two
               sisters (for which was nothing, as it seemed, to be settled
            for them nor for the child that was in me yet
            unborn).</span>
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev178-start">
         
            After I recovered of that dreadful sickness, wherein
            death looked me in the face and threatened my dissolution,
            it was still my great business to endeavour to obtain
            that the estate should be settled as at the first intended.
            And it was my desire to Mr Legard, he would draw
            up a deed for my jointure to be made firm accordingly —

             according to that entail — to be of East Newton
            settled after our death upon my heirs, male or
            female, and that without power to cut it off from them.
         
            As for Leysthorpe, it was also to be entailed, according to the intention of the said articles, upon my heirs,
            male or female, without power to cut it off (only
            in regard that Burn Park was sold and the money
            disposed of, as before mentioned. Videlicet. To pay Mr
               Nettleton £1000 or those of which Mr Thornton had
            borrowed money to pay him with at Hull, Mr Skinner).
          And the other £1000 to purchase the rentcharge
             of Ralph Crathorne of £80 per annum, out of which his brothers
            and sisters was paid the interest of their portions
            (as Mr Thornton told me).
         
            And that my £1500 out of England was all
            disposed of, and nothing left from debts to be for
            all the younger children that I should have.
         
            Whereby they, and my heir too, was left at an
            uncertainty by the paper draft sent from
            London by Mr Legard. Though I had prayed him to
             get done with some provisions for maintenance
            and portions for them to be set out of Leysthorpe (as
            it had been before out of Burn Park settled before
            marriage for them) and because I could not yield
            to pass a fine before Mr Thornton did solemnly
            promise to make some provision for them out of 
            
            Leysthorpe, nor to cut my children quit out of all,
            I thought it a very hard thing to do to them without it.

         Though I did my best endeavours to leave all things
            in the best state I could and secured to them the estate
            by this means, as I hoped by Mr Legard to have
            done without any further trouble to Mr Thornton and
            myself.
         
            Yet, when I perused Mr Legard's paper draft —
            which I had entrusted him to draw up according to
            these articles and Mr Thornton's promise to me before 
            Baron Thorpe for the entail and provision of children —
            I found his letter, received from Mr Legard (dated
            June 18th, 1662) and the paper draft, drawn far
            contrary either as to the settlements themselves (for
            my jointure out of Newton) or Leysthorpe; both the
            uses quite different and contrary to my directions, and
            Mr Thornton's articles and promises to me. So that I
            was in a very great concern for it, and told Mr
            Thornton that I desired to be better satisfied before 
            the writings were drawn.</span>
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev180-start">
         
            Upon which, I was 
            forced to send to Mr Covill, counsellor,
            which had been made use of many times in case of
            his opinion (concerning all those things in question
            betwixt Sir Christopher Wandesford and Mr Thornton) who set
            things aright for my husband and ordered those affairs.
          Mr Covill, in his letter of August 22, 1662, when I writ to
            him and sent my writings and the paper draft of Mr Legard
             to consult with him, delivered his opinion candidly of
            those concerns and did find the paper draft not to answer those settlements and entails as ought to be done,
             and promised to come over  to Newton and do all things to both
             our satisfactions. But, in regard I have been so much 
             condemned for this deed, which was made by Mr Covill,
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.242&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 242</a>





         

         it will not be amiss to vindicate the alteration of
             the first jointure deed (made by Sir Robert Barwick)
             contrary to the true intent of the marriage articles.
            And also to vindicate my cause and reasons not
            to have the settlements of Newton and Leysthorpe
             to pass according to Mr Legard's paper book
             (which he, in his letter of June 18, 1662, sent with it, by Mr Thornton
            from London, when he should have stopped Nettleton
             from breaking up the execution and against him).
          
          
          
          Therefore, I judge it necessary to insert the
             original letter of my cousin Covill about it.
          
      
       
         
         
                      
         Dear cousin,
            I have seriously perused all the writings you sent me,
            and I perceive that the intent of the articles made upon marriage (albeit, it be not therein so fully expressed as might have been) was to entail the
            manor of East Newton on yourself and your issues
            begotten by my cousin Thornton. The jointure deed
            is not made pursuant to the intent of the articles
               and by that deed, my cousin Thornton, after your decease,
            might have barred the entail and cut out all your
            issues from any benefit by that deed, which he and you
               now have done by your late  fine passing, so that
            I conceive that deed is out of doors.
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.243&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 243</a>





         
         
            As for your paper draft and new intended settlement;
               I like it better than the first deed, but yet the provisos
               therein mentioned do trouble it. The first proviso,
               folio 17, doth alter the intent of the articles; for, by
               it, your daughters (in case you have not any son) may
               be deprived of Newton upon payment of £3000 to them. But by the second proviso,
               folio 19, my cousin Thornton hath power (after your
               decease) to make a jointure of all Newton, or of
            any part thereof, to any second wife or wives which
               he shall marry after your death, which may prove very
               prejudicial to your children. There being then,
            no present provision at all upon any of your
            issues but left at liberty to my cousin to dispose
               of as he pleaseth (as you may see, folio 12).
         
            The second proviso, for making of a jointure
            to a second wife, I like the worst of  any part of the
            intended settlement. For by the first proviso, which you
            scruple at, a son by a second venture cannot have
            Newton but upon his payment of £3000
             to your daughters
            and, until then, the estate will remain in your daughters',
            so that he cannot defeat it but by payment of the
            money. One thing your paper draft wants, which is
            in your jointure deed, and that is provision for your
            relief out of the lands in Leysthorpe for what lands
            shall be evicted from you in Newton, but I hope there
            need no fear of this. I intend, God willing, to set
            forward towards Newton the first of September and shall
            reason the case with my cousin Thornton about the paper book
            and your doubts, and hope to give satisfaction to you both.
         
          
        
        
         
        
          
          
        
    
         
            Thus far concerns this business as to the settlement,
            intended to be done for my better security or for my children's,
            which I had no cause to like; it being so far from mending
            as it quite destroyed the entail and deprived my issue of
            their birthright, and to do it to other purposes.
          To which intent, it seems, I was advised to pass a fine
             of Newton which utterly destroyed it and of Leysthorpe too.
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.244&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 244</a>





         

         
            Pretence by Mr Legard to have settled it firmer
            on my issues than Newton and Leysthorpe was done by the
            first jointure deed. Indeed, this was a great 
            fallacy showed to me by him whom I relied upon
            for true and faithful dealing. And, it seems, that
            great straits I was put upon (in my distress, in
            my sickness) to have somewhat settled for my children
            at present if I had died (a bond of £6000 to give
            them) was made use of as a snare to cut them
            and all my issues from their inheritance which deed
            I would not have done for the world. But the fine I passed
            made me fear some worse thing, after I saw the
            paper book.
          
          
          
    
         
            But, by the good providence of my gracious
            God upon me, I had so much notion of the
            thing that I could not be satisfied until I had
            my cousin Covill's advice and assistance to
            the drawing of the settlements (both of Newton and
            Leysthorpe) more to my satisfaction and security of
            my children's inheritance and provisions.
          But, in regard Mr Thornton's debts was very
            high and that would be more speedily paid than
             could be raised out of the land, I was (upon Mr
            Thornton's desire and upon condition that the younger
             children should not be totally left unprovided for)
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.245&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 245</a>





         
          
              willing that my £1000 portion — which was to
             be out of Ireland by my father's will and to have been
             laid out in land for me as an addition to my jointure,
            and appears by articles of marriage and Mr Thornton's bond to
             secure the same for my use —
          
             I say to show my love to the whole family, I was
            content to let it go to Mr Thornton's use to pay his debts,
            whereby the estate might be cleared and my younger
            children to have a certainty settled for them out 
            of Leysthorpe, according to his engagement before the
            judge, Baron Thorpe: on which terms I yielded to
            pass a fine on Burn Park which was settled for that
            purpose before marriage.
         
            After which agreement, the settlement of Newton
            and Leysthorpe was made with Mr Thornton's full 
            consent, who both nominated the portions and main 
            tenancy which they were to have out of the land
            (which, considering my own fortune, was not to
            be judged so high when there was but £1500 betwixt
            the two daughters, if no more of them, but if any
            more younger children then their shares to be less).
            However, the land was entailed, by this settlement
            of cousin Covill, upon my issues (both of Newton
            and Leysthorpe) without power of cutting it off from them
            or defalcation, which was not so done by either of the
            other deeds as was intended by articles of marriage.
         
            But now, it was a matter of great trouble to 
            me (that by reason of these unhappy and unfortunate
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.246&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 246</a>





         

            debts of Mr Thornton and his sad engagements,
            all his estate was so involved and burdened) that
            the first provisions of Burn Park being gone from
            them and Leysthorpe forced to be charged with it
            which, if it should please God to give me a son,
            was entailed on him by the articles first made.
         But things being so sadly cross on Mr Thornton
            and myself that all my fortune did 
            
            
            little
            
            good to
            us or
            our children, but fixed for debts and my
            brothers' and sisters' portions. There was no visible
            allowance or provision for a son, if I had one,
            which did extremely concern me for it and
            Mr Thornton also, but it could be no way
            helped and leave anything certain (my portion    
            gone). 
         
         
            But I did at that time promise to Mr Thornton
            that — if in case God should please to leave me and
            call for him first — that I would by God's grace
            (if he gave me a son to live) that I would be
            a kind mother to him and give him the best
            education and maintenance I could (considering
            my low estate and the debts, and to leave myself
            anything to subsist on for the love I bear to
            himself and family).
          And, if pleased God to take me first out of
             this world, I hoped he would be a kind father
             to my son (if I left one behind me) and take care
            of him

             When this business of settlement was in doing, I was
             willing to pay all charges belonging to fees and clerks,
             and counsel, and did (out of my own purse that my dear
                mother had given me) pay Mr Covill's charges and fees and
            gratuity which might cost me about 
            
            
            
            £20
            
            
            .	
         
          One thing I had forgotten to mention I was willing —
             out of my great love to Mr Thornton and his family —
             to do, and deprive myself of that privilege I had
             (by my first deed of jointure) to have it with power
            
            
            and without
            
            
             impeachment of any manner of waste, by which
            I might have had the privilege of cutting down the
             wood, et cetera. But I did desire only to leave myself liberty
             for all manner of uses of ploughbote, stileboot, housebout,
             firebote and what I needed, being so desirous to preserve
            the same to posterity. This was no act of unkindness
             to all the family, when I did forgo so great a privilege,
            as well as to give up all my portion by my father and
             many hundreds of my mother's, which she gave me for my own
             uses and necessities which I was daily put to.

            While this affair was in acting, one day was going down the stairs to the parlour with bottles of ale, et cetera,
            to entertain the company there, my hands being
            full, there was Celia Danby (here with her mother, Mrs
               Danby), my nephew Christopher's daughter  — a child of
            four years old — when she was going down before me, tumbled
            down a great part of the stairs and fell desperately on her
            head. At which I was much frighted and, in making
            haste to save her, I got a very desperate fall down four
            stairs with my knees, which did shake and bruise me much, and
            had like to bring me to my labour before my time.</span>

            My dear husband, having been drawn into this
            trouble of engagement for my father's debts, was no
            small grief unto me; having been advised by his two
            uncle Darleys
            (Richard and Francis) to take on him the assignment (from my uncle, Maulger Norton) on purpose
            to be more enabled to take possession of that estate of
            Idough in Ireland, which was charged (by my honoured father's
            will) for payment of debts and my mother's annuity of
            £300
            per annum and with £6000 to fall on my brother, John Wandesford,
            in case of George's  death, and of £1000 portion more, then
            £1500 out of England to myself, with legacies and maintenances. 
            All these things was very fair, and but our dues to be
            paid thence, and sufficiently secured by the will of my father

            and that estate gotten out of the rebels' hand in Ireland,
            and also possession from Captain Preston's son-in-law to
            Mr William Wandesford, executor. And might have been
            more easy to have been compassed by us had he not been
            persuaded to take upon him the trust, which pulled on him
            the whole charge to pay others out of it before himself
            (as the effect proved). For I have seen a great bill
            under his hand of charges upon that account which
            is entitled 'A True Account of Moneys Expended
            in Several Suits, and since I Received an Assignment of
            the Lease of Castlecomer in August, 1656'.
               
            
            
        
            Which account amounts to a great sum of
           money, 
            
           £3,548 16s. 11d, 
            
            
            as appears by his note,
            since that time and 
            1659, October 1st,
            
            besides what it has done since upon that occasion.</span><span class="event" id="ev184a-start">
         
            Insomuch that he was forced to borrow great sums
            to discharge those suits and engagements, as may appear
            in the said note: he, being bound to Mr Nettleton and Mr
               Skinner of Hull (in £1000
            to Nettleton and £600 to Skinner)
            both in statutes staple, and of a dangerous consequence
            if not paid punctually. As for Mr Skinner, I find his
            statute discharged by Mr Thornton (entered into May 6th,
            1658) and paid and acknowledged before Mr Charles
               Foxley, mayor of Hull (April 27th, 1668) and cleared,
            and delivered up then (to Mr Thornton by Mr Foxley)
            the statute and recorded in it, according to law in those
            cases.

            But, as to Mr Robert Nettleton, his statute was not delivered up nor all discharged, but he continued very
            stubborn and demanded more than Mr Thornton did
            engage for; so that suits proceeded, and he followed Mr
               Thornton very severely, because he had not what he demanded, which heavily fell on me and my children.
            
            
          
    
         
            About the year 1656,
            
           
           Mr Thornton carrying me to York to see our 
            
            
            friends in the assize week: I, knowing no other
            business I had there, one morning, being in
            bed with him, he began to be very melancholy troubled.
            I, asking him how he did and what ailed him? Was
            he not well? On which, he said he was much troubled
            at a business which was like to befall him presently
            if I did not help him out of it.
            
            I told him, he knew — dear heart — I had never
            denied anything within my power to do him good.
            He said, I must go before Baron Thorpe with him
            this morning. I asked him, for what? I had nothing
            to do with him, on which he told me:
             that, that unfortunate business of the assignment
            of Maulger Norton, had compelled him to enter into
            a statute to secure Nettleton's debt, which he would have
            done out of his own estate and not out of Ireland,
            and now he prosecuted him with such rigour that, if he
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.251&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 251</a>





         

did not pay him this sizes, he would have him to the
            jail. I told him, being surprised at this sad news
            for my breakfast, 'Alas, he could not compel you to
            have done it out of your own, there being so great an
               estate out of Ireland out of which it must be paid'
            (and myself and mother had begged him not to meddle
            with that assignment because of the trouble of it).
         
            He said, he was sorry for it but could not now
            help it, and he must go to prison if I would not
            bring him out of those straits by passing a fine of
            Burn Park (which he had bond money on of Mr
            Foxley of Hull and had sold him that estate to
            pay Nettleton). And, if I would not consent to join
            in a fine before Baron Thorpe that day, he saw no
            way but to go to jail for my father's debt.</span><span class="event" id="ev185a-start">
            This speech did much terrify me, to be so suddenly surprised and of so sad a nature; being great with
               child, I fell into a great sorrow for it,
         both for the misfortune of my husband and
            the affliction of myself, and the dishonour of my
            dear father's debt to fall upon us. And that by his own
            act and deed: he not being compelled to it in law or equity.
         But the great concern was to me: I must
            either yield to destroy my children or my husband.
            For if that land was sold, there was none to make
            it out of for any provisions for my younger children
            but Leysthorpe, which was for a provision for my heirs
            if I had one, and if I did not do this rash act, I
            might have my husband in prison for my dear father's
            debt. So, I said, I was in a great strait what to do and
            why would he not be so kind to tell me before I came?
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.252&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 252</a>





         

            He said, he durst not, for it would not been granted
            to by my mother. I said, she would have helped him
            with some money to have satisfied Nettleton but
            she knows nothing. I was in a great consternation
            at this sad news, and so suddenly taken, and begged
            of God to help me out of this trouble and my husband.
         
            So, I told him, 'Dear heart, if I did yield
            for your sake to pass this fine, what will become of
            all my younger children?' (having three then for maintenance
            and portions for them). For that he did assure me,
            if I would for his sake yield to do this thing
            for him and deliver him out of this great danger,
            he would take it for the kindest part I could do
            and faithfully did assure and engage to me that
            he would provide for his younger children's
            maintenance and portions for them, out of his
            land of Leysthorpe, of £100
             per annum.
         
         
            Upon which consideration and faithful promise
               
            
            
            to me he would do so — and give the rest of the
            lands in Leysthorpe to his son's maintenance, if
            he had any, as heir that he might be provided for
            too — provided he would perform this promise, I
            would be content to pay a fine, though it would go
            very hard with me to have his land pay my father's
            debts secured by my father's deeds and will.
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.253&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 253</a>





         
            
         
         
            But he said, he questioned not to have it paid him
            by my brother, Christopher Wandesford, out of that estate afterwards
            which, I bless God, afterwards he did (by the agreement
            
            
            of Baron Thorpe when Mr Thornton delivered up the estate to him).
         
            So, thus was I compelled, with a sad heart, to
            yield to Mr Thornton's desire and so he carried me before
            him that day, who took me aside and questioned
            my willingness to pass a fine of this estate.
             I answered my Lord that, indeed, it was a surprise
            to me that Mr Thornton should have occasion
             to sell
               his land, having had a considerable portion with me and that it was all I had settled for
            provisions for younger children. But my
               husband, I trusted, was an honest man and he
               would perform his promise: who did promise to
            me he would settle as good an estate out of Leysthorpe
               (as £100 per annum for their maintenance and portions)
               and the rest to be for my heir, if I had any. And upon
               those conditions, I shall be more willing: being
            in a great strait what to do and would show my love
            to my husband.
         
            Upon which, my 
               Lord said, 'Mr Thornton, I find your
            wife is a kind wife to you. And she saith this estate
            is all the provision for her younger children and,
            if you will settle as good one out of Leysthorpe as this
            of £100 a year and the rest for her heir, she is willing.
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.254&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 254</a>





         

         I cannot blame her to take care for all her children
       . Are you willing to settle an estate accordingly as
            you promised her?' Upon which, Mr Thornton did
            very solemnly profess and promise and engage himself to do so, and settle the same estate out of
            Leysthorpe, 'and this, I promise before your lordship'.
         
         
            Then said my Lord, 'I find your wife is a kind
            wife to you, and a kind mother to take care
            for her children: see
               
            that you do so as you engaged'.
            Upon which, he said he would by God's help, and
            upon which consideration and conditions the fine
            was passed by me and on no other conditions.</span><span class="event" id="ev186-start">
         
            But this settlement was never made or
            done all this time, and made me concerned for it
            in my sickness at Oswaldkirk; nor anything in lieu of it
            remaining, that estate — as Mr Legard said — in Mr
               Thornton's power to evict them and all my issues,
            which was so considered (then in my extremity) to
            get that bond of £6000
            to secure £3000 to the only issue
            I had alive (two daughters for the present, until it
            pleased God I should recover of that great
               
             sickness
            and brought out my son at Newton afterwards).
            But I judged it not safe to let the settlements go
               undone, until I was delivered,</span><span class="event" id="evn11-start">and so Mr Covill drew that,

            as I have observed before, and related and the reasons
            why these portions was so allotted them by their
            
            
               father (having parted with all the fortune I had
            from them for debts, which otherwise would have been
            better for them to have been paid in money of mine).
         Nor could this settlements of the whole estate
            be gotten done until about a month before my being
            delivered of my son Thornton, which I was very
            joyful that the Lord did give me leave to
            live to see it done before I thought I should have
            died. And my cousin Covill did assure me that
            he had drawn the settlements so well and
            firm that it could not possibly be cut off
            except I should give my consent to it, which he
            did give me a strict charge that I should not
            consent to the ruin of my children. To which,
            I promised I never would do by God's help.
            He said, if I did, I should never get them so
            done again.</span><span class="event" id="ev187-start">
         
            But several years after Harry Best (who
            had married my niece, Katherine Danby) came
            to me in a very sifting way, about that time when
           Mr Thornton borrowed
               
            
            the £100 of horse race money
            (though I knew not of it then).
         
            And told me that his uncle Thornton had need
            of money, and that he desired me that I would do
            as much as yield to cut off some of the land of

         Leysthorpe, if I would not cut off the entail
            of Covill. I told him, I was very sorry that
            Mr Thornton had need of any more money — for debt;
            having given all my English portion and
            also my £1000 out of Ireland, I gave for debts
            on purpose to clear his estate and that Leysthorpe
            might remain entire for his children by me — 
            and so desired to satisfy Mr Thornton in it.
         
            But he, pressing me to this, and he, being a
            trustee nominated in that deed of cousin Covill's,
            I thought to have his advice about it
            whether it were not drawn so firm that
            it could not be cut off without my consent.
         And so very innocently showed him that
            deed which, when he had read it, he did tell
            me that Mr Thornton could cut off the entail without my consent. And charged me by no
            means to let him see it, nor know of it;
            for, if he did, he would certainly do it of
             himself without my consent and then it
            would be worse for me and my children.
            I told him, 'If it were so, I am sure it was
            not done wilfully by cousin Covill because he knew
               the ill consequence of such a thing', and said, 'I would

         not be so ill a person as to destroy that deed which I got
               done so hardly for my children because of the debts'.
         
            But begged of him, Mr Best, as he was a friend to
            myself and children — having none of my own relations
            to stand for me, but him and he, being a trustee in that
            deed — so he would not discover that which he said
            he found out to Mr Thornton, whereby that entail
            might be cut off and settled for other uses.
         Upon which words, he did promise and faithfully
            engage to me upon his faith that he would not
            betray my cause to Mr Thornton, nor discover the failing in that
            settlement; on which promise, I relied, nor did think
            that he would have done so treacherously to me
            as it did prove afterwards.
            For I was told by a good friend, after all was
               done, that Mr Best, immediately after he had discovered this thing, he went to Mr Thornton and
            told him that it was in his power to cut off the
            entail of Mr Covill without my consent.
            And did put him into a way to do it and showed
            him that the fault was in the contingencies which Covill knew
               not. But, by his leave, Covill did know the contingency
            that the portions should not be paid but in case of
               my death, as it was so ordered to befriend Mr Thornton,

               or his second marriage, that these two children (I,
               then had) might not be defrauded of both the
               inheritance and birthright, as it was intended by
            Legard's deed, but only to have a certainty out
               of Leysthorpe secured for them, which was redeemable by
               either their father paying £1500, or by their brother
               (if they had one) who had Newton secured to him
               by Covill's entail and Leysthorpe, too, after the
               payment of his sisters' portions, it was to be freed.
            And I do say, it was Mr Thornton himself —
               and of his own motion and goodwill — which did appoint
               to them this sum of £1500 to them, saying that
            it was but reasonable they should have so
            much, because I had put it to him what he would
            please to allow them and said he had got a very
            considerable fortune with me, by my father and
            mother, and they should have so much.
            And this, and more to that purpose, I heard him
               speak in the little parlour before Mr Covill and many
               more present. Therefore, if he knew what reason
            he had and did it himself, none need to lay it on
               me that it was my act to overcharge his estate,
            when I was like to be burdened myself by parting
            with all my fortune from all my children for debts and to

free his estate, and himself, of that trouble. And
               was willing to do more than that: to take on me the
               education of my son, if I had any to live.
         
            
            The relation I have made of Mr Best's kindness
            to me, or rather his hard dealing and treachery,
            which betrayed his friend and forfeited his faith, I had
            not suspected in the least but by the sad consequence
            which followed upon it as to the cutting off the entail.</span><span class="event" id="evn12-start">
            And not only in that point was cruel to myself
            and poor children, for whom I entrusted him,
            
            but showed itself in point of drawing up of
            the writings and settlement, which I got him to make
            for my poor children of the disposing of my dear
            mother's goods and monies and personal estate, which
            she — by her last will and testament — gave me for my
            life and to dispose of at my death to my children 
            as I should see cause and best deserving.
         
            She made her deed so warily (perceiving
            that Mr Thornton's estate was so deeply dipped in
            debt that if she had not so disposed them to be free
            of that, I nor mine would not have been better for what she
            gave us) but took care we should have the use for
            our conveniency in Mr Thornton's life and mine, but not to be wronged of them
            or charged by any debts, whatever, for which I bless God.

            But I, upon my disposal of them 
            by deed according
            to her will, desired Mr Best to make the deed
            after the same manner as my mother's dispose.
         
            Yet, contrarily to that, neither as a true friend
            to me or my children, he drew those writings,
            which I was to sign, in such a manner as to
            make all her personal estate (given to my poor
            children and myself) to be liable to pay the debts
            and to be seized upon for them at present.
            Which thing, Mr Thornton did declare to me
            he did not know nor had a hand in it and was
            not pleased with it; so that I never would seal
               the same, although they cost me a great deal of
            charges to draw and engross for fees, and to him and
            his clerk which was done at Newton.

            Thus, I have daily cause to see, there is no
            trust in man but may fail me. And I have had
            great experience of man's treachery, but of my
            gracious
             God and merciful Father's great power
            and compassion towards me in all the great concerns of my life, I have infinitely great cause
            to praise, and bless and glorify his most holy name which
            has still discovered, and prevented, the ruin of myself
            and children. Oh, that we may walk answerably to all
            these, his favours, and put my trust always in him forever.

            The second: through grief at a strange accident
            that happened me, when I was pretty big of him of a
            fright which came on me by a surprise of the sight
            of a penknife which was nigh to have hurt one.
            The fear and dread apprehension thereof did 
            cause a mark of a deep, bloody colour upon
            the child's heart, most pure and distinct and of
            several shapes, continuing so as nothing could
            wash them off:  —1 — the first appearance like a stab
            or cut with a penknife, with many pure, distinct
            drops of blood all about it, as if one should
            have sprinkled little drops with their hand on it.
          The second form it came into the direct form of
             a 'T', with the like drops about it of pure blood.
          The third form it came into was exactly
            like the shape of a heart, with drops of blood about it, which continued so long until Mr Thornton
             and myself was much troubled at it, and humbly
            begged of the Lord that he would be gracious to
            us and the child, and to pardon what was amiss and
             to remove this great mark upon the child.
          
          After which, it pleased God that the colour did
             fade by degrees, and grew paler and, bluish and
             about a year or near it, they was quite gone.
             This was seen by many persons at several times:

            four days' time (having begun on Monday and so

continued, by fits, a wearisome time all that
            week, being very big and heavy with my burden).
             On Thursday, my lady Cholmley and my dear
               aunt Norton, my Lady Yorke and Mrs Watson,
            with my sisters Denton and Frances Thornton, was
            with me and stayed until evening, then went home
            to Oswaldkirk; the next day, came again.
            I began to be extreme ill all that night and next day
            but, because I did not quicken speedily (which I could
            not do, he being so great a child) and my sister
               Denton had her son, William, then a crabbed one,
            my sisters did go home about four o'clock, thinking
            I should have gone until next day.
          But, within two hours, my extremity began and I fell
             into excessive torments and racks and, by my
             great extremities, both my Lady Yorke and my
            own maid and several others fell into a sound to
            see me what I endured; so that we dispatched Jane
            Heald to Oswaldkirk to fetch the neighbours to
             assist me, but they did not believe her, but that I
             was delivered before my sisters came away. But
             she protested, I was not, yet they would not come
               
            
            
             to assist in my great extremity, so that I was near
            lost for want of help of those women who came 
             not until the next day after I was delivered.

            But it pleased the most high God, of his
            great grace and mercy, to deliver me out of the
            dreadfullest perils, dangers, travail and torment
            in childbearing to cause me to bring forth
            this, my third son, being half dead in bearing
            him.
          
          
    
         
            My son, Robert Thornton, was born on
            Friday the 19th of September 1662. He was born
            at East Newton betwixt the hours of eight and nine
            o'clock at night (having been since the night
            before in strong labour with him until that time).
            And, I bless God, I had the company and comfort
            and assistance of my dear friends (my aunt
               Norton, my Lady Yorke, my lady Cholmley)
            who sat up with me all that night on 
            
            
            Thursday
            
            
            
            and never left me all Friday, nor Friday at 
            night.</span>
          
         But lest this great mercy should pass
            without its severe monitor to my unbridled
            passion of joy for so excellent a blessing,
            and to be cautioned not to set my affection
            on things below (be they never so necessary or
            grateful, desirable or comfortable) but on him
            alone, and above all in all,

            it pleased God further to exercise me, his 
             poor servant and handmaid, with a very 
             great and desperate weakness; exceeding great,
             even to depriving me of motion and speech and strength,
            beginning a little after my child was born
             and I laid in bed. While all the company was
             got together to view that goodly child and
             admire him — so large and big, newly born, and all
             so fond of him being a son — with great joy,
          I fell into a most desperate extremity of
            flooding; insomuch as it was not hoped
            my life should have been saved. All that night,
            it was terrible to behold of them was about
            me, bringing me into a most desperate condition,
            without all hopes of life: spirits, soul, strength
            seemed all gone from me and I freely resigned
             my
            soul into the hand of my dear saviour and
            redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ.
         
            But in the distraction of my friends for me, that none
            knew what to do to preserve my poor life even then in
            all apprehension passing from me, my Lady Yorke, out
            of her fright, came to my bedside and wept over me. And
            said, 'My dear cousin, you that helps everyone to save
            them, cannot you tell me what would do you good in this
            extremity to save your own?' On which, it pleased my good
            God to enable me, the laying her ear to my mouth, to say only, 'Go
            into closet. Right-hand shelf box. Powder. Syrup of cloves, give
            me'. And by divine providence, she got that box and powder,

which I told her of, and had laid ready for myself
            before my sickness and told my midwife and maid
            of it to give me in such a case, but they had
            forgotten it in their trouble for me. But the gracious
            Lord, my God, brought it into my memory and thus,
            was I, at that time, also preserved by the goodness
            of my gracious God and help of my dear cousin
            at this time; the flood being, by it, stopped immediately.

         After Mr Best had sifted me about my consent
            to grant that Mr Thornton should cut off the settlement
            Mr Covill had made for provisions for my children's
            maintenance and portions (which was to take place if
            either my death or Mr Thornton's happened that they
            might not be left desolate of provisions for their
            subsistence, et cetera) that I, not suspecting any treachery
            from him, a trustee and my own niece's husband, had
            (as I related before) let him see the writing and deed of
            settlement to give his cordial advice to me of it.
            And he pretended to find a flaw in it and promised to
            conceal and not to discover it to my own or my
            children's prejudice.
         
            Yet, did he immediately go to Mr Thornton
            and told him he had seen the deed, and that he had
            power to cut it off, alone, without my consent
            and so ordered the matter that (by his advice,
            I suppose) persuaded Mr Thornton to do it, to make
            a new deed first, wherein he gave livery and seisin
            to Mr Francis Darley (as is mentioned) by which he did
            make himself to make a new deed and cut off the
            former entail, and make a new settlement of the whole
            estate of Leysthorpe to the prejudice and almost ruin
            of all my children.</span><span class="event" id="ev202-start">
         
            Which settlement I did not know, nor see the deed of
            it, until the year 1666 which, by providence, I came to see.
            And the very grief I apprehended was so great at
            that time, on the discovery to me, that it did force me to that
            miscarriage which I had and long continued sickness by the excess of floods (which lasted a long time on me and mentioned in my 'First Book', page 216).</span><a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.276&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 276</a><span class="event" id="ev203-start">
        As I remember, this new deed, which was made instead of Covill's settlement was (by its date) made
           at Stearsby or then about (November 16, 1665) in which
            Leysthorpe was divided in two parts, and the whole
            was charged with a mortgage of 99 years for a
           debt to Mr Portington and Mr Raines of £1400.
           And until all and every part of that debt — with full interest —
            were paid, no other use or uses could be paid out
             of Leysthorpe; as may at large appear, by the
            said mortgages being paid into them by me and my
           moneys out of Ireland since Mr Thornton's
           decease (which debt was also secured to them
            by rentcharges out of Ireland by Mr Anthony
               Norton, Mr Thornton, his executor: they receiving the
           moneys as we got it out of Ireland). 
        But this mortgage, being first over all that estate
           of Leysthorpe, what could be fixed for my children's
            livelihood or secured for them?
        Moreover, the deed was ordered so as but on
            moiety was for their provision; being first charged
           with maintenance and portions for a second wife's child,
            and the other part for a jointure for a second wife
            to go out of it for her provision.

         As also power to charge this estate with Sir Henry
            
            Cholmley's debts, as I have mentioned before.
         
            From whence could any of this estate at Leysthorpe
            be able to afford anything for the relief of any of
            my children: neither heir nor younger children
            could ever get one penny to subsist on. Where,
            then, was the pretence by Mr Best that I need not
            take such care for settlement for my children
            when it was better done for them than by Mr Covill's
            deed? It may be judged by any indifferent person
            that I could not be able to go out of this world
            with a quiet conscience to leave the children of my
            body thus forlorn, and contrary to all agreements
            made before and after marriage for mine.
         There was likewise a provision in this deed
            which never was in any before, nor ever entered it into
            my friend's intentions or Mr Thornton's.
         
            Videlicet. That in case my husband should die
            without any heirs male of his body by me and that his
            daughters (heirs female) should have the land of
            Leysthorpe that they should pay unto the brothers
               and sisters of Mr Thornton the sum of £1500
            amongst them, which sum was so great that it
            was above the purchase of the land. And they had been
            better without the land than buy it at so high a price.
        After the discovery of this deed which, by Mr
           Thornton's great kindness, he pleased to let my brother
            Denton to show me for my satisfaction, I was indeed
           surprised.</span> But, before I relate this, I must mention what

         befell me, and what a sad accident came upon me
           (August 16th, 1666) and not cleared of that flux of blood
           until October the 4th,
              1666.

          After the drinking of Scarborough waters,
             not then mistrusting myself to have been conceived,
            Mr Thornton sent for me to York about some
            business with my Lord Frescheville.
             My uncle, Francis Darley, was in company with me
             and my nephew, Kitt Danby. I was very faint in the
            morning and eat nothing before I went and the water
             wrought with riding. I told Kitt Danby, I was
            sick and faint and would have lighted to refresh myself a little at Strensall.
          But uncle Darley would not grant it. Said we
            should be soon at York and so I did not take any
            refreshment for displeasing of him, which indeed my
            dear husband was sorry for and would have had
             me done. This did somewhat disorder me then, but
            I got home pretty well,</span><span class="event" id="ev204a-start">but that which was most
            hurt to me was the news of the cutting off the last
             deed of settlement by Mr Covill from my children,
            which struck me into a sudden grief when I was told
             how it was and what the consequence was of it.
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.279&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 279</a>





         

             Upon which my grief and concern was so great —
            which I had upon the notice of this action to be
            passed and no certain provision out of all
            my own fortune or my husband's whole
            estate — that I fell into a sad trembling and
             shaking of an ague and, as I walked with my
                brother Denton in the hall and discoursed of this,
            I found myself extremely ill in my body
            as well as mind. And so proceeded to great
            extremity of those which broke suddenly
            on me and began to be violent and weakened me
            so greatly that I could not expect but
             my death should proceed. And, though Dr Wittie
             was called to use his best art and skill,
            yet such was my inward grief and affliction
            for this unkind part towards me and the 
            children of my womb that I could take no
             ease and rest, joining with my daily expectation
             of death. And that again aggravated by the 
            knowing there was nothing fixed for none
             of my children, neither son nor daughters,
            and that my cutting myself and mine of the
             benefit of my £1000 out of Ireland, (to pay
             debts and to purchase for my two daughters I had,

             each of them, £800 portion and some fixed
             maintenance for them) that — being now by
            this cutting off this deed by Mr Thornton's
            act — I had no hopes ever to have  them
            maintained or to be provided for. And
             also, foreseeing my own approach of death,
             had not one faithful friend (since Mr
               Best betrayed me) that I could leave matters
            
            with all my three poor children which tormented
            me most of all, assuring myself that this
            provision for a second
             wife was done to no end.
            
         
         
            Nor was I so desirous to live in this
            sad world of deceit had it not been in
            regard of my poor children: to have
            left them as beggars instead of provision
            to have kept them like children of ours and
            not as bastards which I saw nothing done for
            them. The full relation of my sad condition,
            the meditations thereupon, and the present
            cure my gracious God and <span class="evquote">Father of mercies</span>
            showed to me, is fully declared in my 'First
               Book', and also a 'Book of Meditations'
               
             made
            on purpose in the year, August 16, 1666.

            But since I have, for my own vindication,
            been forced to make several discourses of my
            unfortunate falling under the <span class="evquote">scourge of the
            tongue</span> by slanders and lies, I am, moreover,
            obliged to make some more observations
            to make apparent my clearness and innocency , and why I was wronged in this
            manner, even for the discharge of my duty
            which lay upon me by the provision for my poor
            children. For, after I was restored to
            life again in this miraculous manner — as
            the hemmorist was in the gospel and that day
            this history was read in my chamber of our
            saviour's cure done upon that poor woman —
            he gave me grace to believe in him and to lay hold
            on him by faith that he was as well able to
            cure me as he did that poor woman (St Mathew 9: 
            21-22. <span class="evquote">If I may but touch his garment I shall
            be made whole</span>) and, so, I was, from that same hour,
            which infinite mercy I have and must acknowledge
            to his great glory, all the days of my life. Amen.
         </span><span class="event" id="evn13-start">
            I say that, after I was recruited in strength,
            I hoped it was for some good providence to my

            poor children, and so I was set on work
            to do my endeavour to rectify that business
            about them. And by finding out that
            business, how to know what was done in it.
         
            And when Mr Comber did go to London,
            about his taking of the Master of Arts degree, 
            desired he would examine Mr Best of it,
            whether that Covill's deed and entail was cut off,
            who answered, it was and that I need not question
            but the new deed was drawn better than
            Mr Covill's was for my children.
         
            When Mr Comber writ word of this from 
            London, I was surprised at it and more concerned;
             for I knew it overthrew their interest and
            right and was more troubled, but begged of God
            he would please to direct me what to do for them.
            At Mr Comber's return home, he acquainted
            me with matter and would have persuaded me
            that the last deed was done well enough as
            Mr Best told him. But I was much dissatisfied
            and until I saw it, which I obtained by my brother Denton
            (who I begged that Mr Thornton would please to let him
            show it to me, being then big with child, and
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.283&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 283</a>





         
            
            
         
         desired to go out of the world with a quiet
            mind if it were done for my children's good).
            At last, I got the sight to read it over by myself, when I was in a greater consternation
            than before to see that so great alterations was
            in it. As first, only one half of Leysthorpe settled
            for my children's portions and maintenance, and
            that a lease of 99 years to take place before
            to secure Mr Portington and Mr Raines (for which I
            had parted with my £1000 in Ireland to pay them).
         
            And next, that a settlement was made for
            a second wife's jointure and for provision for
            a second wife's children, and all to be before one
            penny to be paid for my poor dear children —
            none of them — until these was satisfied.
            Then, in case that Mr Thornton died without issue
            male, that my daughters was heirs they
            should pay out of Leysthorpe, the sum of £1500
            out of the land. All which was so great a grief
            to me that I was not able to bear it.
          </span><span class="event" id="ev205-start">
            But having considered this matter, and that
            I was near my delivery, I had none to apply
            for redress to have this altered. And did show
            this deed to Mr Comber, who judged the case was
            very hard and gave me his best assistance.
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.284&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 284</a>





         

         
            
            
         And I was forced to send him to several
            counsellors to have their opinions in the case,
            and had several journeys, and put me to great
            charges to have it right drawn, as it was
            done by the last deed made by Mr Thornton,
            the year before he died.
         
            The constant trouble was much which I was
            forced to put upon myself and him — in perusing
            writings and other occasions accruing in that concern
            because the thing in itself would have looked
            strange to have acquainted my own relation
            with these things — made me do it in what secret
            manner I could, and only my daughter, Alice,
            and myself and him was privy to it (besides Mr
               Thornton, who was the party, and my brother Denton).
            So that this might be occasion of those evil
            persons — that hated me and my children — to judge
            ill of the honestest actions in the world.
            For, while my sorrow was so great and expecting
            of my death shortly and would have had this
            business finished before I laid in of my last
               child, 
            </span><span class="event" id="ev206-start">there happened also a proposal of marriage
            by Mr Comber to Mr Thornton that he would 
            please to accept of him for my daughter, Alice,
            and if he pleased to grant that request, he would

             think himself happy in such a wife,
            and would stay his leisureif it were seven years.
         
            Mr Thornton gave him many thanks
            for his respect to my daughter but she was
            very young to marry, and he would not have
            him to hinder his good fortune but dispose
            of himself sooner than he could marry her.
            Upon which, Mr Comber replied that he had a 
            greater honour for Mrs Alice than anyone in
            the world and, if he pleased to consent, he would
            wait his own time, so he might but obtain
            that happiness at last.
         
            Mr Thornton did give him thanks for his
            good opinion of her and said, if he would
            stay until her age to be disposed of, he might
            be as like to obtain, hoping that he would be
            a good and kind husband to her if she married.
          So, upon this hopes, Mr Comber did solicit
            my consent, and I told him she was so young
            that he might have some other and would be more
             suitable (she being inexperienced and would
             be long before she was fit to be disposed).
         
            All these things was answered by his earnest
            desire and solicitation, and testimony of his great
            respect and affection, as witness his earnest letters,
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.286&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 286</a>





         

            he writ to her and myself in that concern.
            On the other side, I had encouragement to
            hope he would prove very good and to love
            her, and by God's grace might be happy for them
            both. Therefore, did not refuse this motion,
            being, I considered, my dear husband 
            and myself was but in a weak condition
            (his palsy fits coming so often on him
            and my own uncertainty of outliving
            my childbearing). And now this late sad
            scene acted — in the unsettling this estate — 
            and feared the worst after my decease,
            if none of my children were not disposed
            or married before I died, so that I begged of my
            God to direct me in this great concern of
            my life that I might do nothing displeasing
            to his majesty, but that might have his blessing
            to go along with us.
          Besides, I found, if I left my children so
             young without a guide in their religion,
            which was my greatest fear, and God should
             take us both from them, I knew not what ill
            consequence that might be to them nor into
            what hands they might fall into.
         
            My poor son, Robert, being but six years old,
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.287&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 287</a>





         

         would want a guide to instruct him and to
            support him in his youth and education in the
            true faith and religion, with his sisters which
            did not yet understand the profession of
            the Church of England; so that, having all
            these good motives, it did overbalance that
            objection of her friends who did say Mr Comber
            had no estate and it was an undervaluing.
         
            But, since my hopes was this gentleman would
            make so good a proof and was an excellent scholar
            hopeful to rise in the world by his own pains and
            industry for all these good ends, I did more incline to this motion. And hoped he might be a 
            stay and a succour to all my children when we
            were gone.</span><span class="event" id="ev207-start">Therefore, was Mr Thornton and myself
            very desirous to settle 
             him here in this living 
            (to have him settled in this living at Stonegrave)
            and we did both desire my Lord Frescheville, my good
            uncle, to procure the perpetual advowson of the
            living of the king that we might have it annexed to his estate at East Newton.
          A benefit so great and desirable, in the consideration
             of this family, that Mr Thornton endeavoured to get
             the same confirmed by the King Charles II,
            
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.288&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 288</a>





         

             which my dear lord did join with us in, and
            solicited that business so far until he writ me
             word, he had so good and kind a master of the
            king that he would deny him nothing in his
             power to grant. But my lord had taken advice
             in that thing and counsel told him, it was in
            the king's power to sell the advowson for his
             time but no more, it being annexed to the crown
             and could not be alienated. But, if Mr Thornton
             would have it done, he could get it for £300.
            When we heard that was no otherwise to be got
            but subject to a change upon the king, we did
            not prosecute that design anymore.
          
          
    
         
            But deemed it the best way to secure the present
            enjoyment for Mr Bennett's life and to take a
            lease for three years, wherein Mr Thornton did
            much rejoice that it might be so well supplied
            as by Mr Comber. So, upon Mr Bennett's coming
            over, he, with my brother Denton, did treat with Mr
               Bennett who, before, was resolved to marry one of
            his daughters to Mr Culliss and, for her portion, to give
            her Stonegrave living (having one at his own
            counting). And that man did so threaten the parish
            that he would only send a curate to read prayers
            
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.289&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 289</a>





         

         and give him £10 a year for it
            but not find a preaching minister, which did
            so grieve my dear husband that he said he
            would leave his house and live where he might
            have the word of God preached.
         
            After Mr Bennett came 
            to, terms was made
            betwixt them (Mr Comber being then at London
            and knew nothing until afterwards). And so,
            Mr Bennett stuck upon the whole year's
            profit due at Whitsuntide then. And, unless
            Mr Thornton would pay £100
            then, at entrance, he would not grant to
            terms, which my brother Denton knew my
            husband would not grant nor indeed had
            it to pay. So that, on conditions the lease
            should be done and agreement made with Mr Thornton,
            I was willing to pay that £100 to Mr Bennett
            but my husband did not know of it (only
            I procured this money out of my dear
               mother's land, which I let Butterfield have
            a lease of until it was run out and paid that
            money down to Mr Bennett, June 25, 1666).
            After which, the lease was done and he to have 100d
            a year out of the living; my husband farming 
            it of him for three years, and he to find a preaching
            minister.

            So, upon these terms, Mr Thornton
            was very desirous to have Mr Comber to 
            supply, that he might enjoy the living and
            what was to be made of it over and besides
            this £100 per annum. But, I fear, there was not
            much got out of it (besides for the officiating
            the cure) until Mr Bennett was persuaded
            to let Mr Thornton enjoy a lease of it for
            his life, which he did upon payment of some
            more rent which was not had out of either
            Mr Thornton, or the living or Mr Comber.
            But let that pass. What was done, was done
            with a sincere heart towards God and, in an
            and for, the best ends to be an establishment
            to the family in this true religion and faith
            of God and to provide a standing ministry
            also (in regard of the expectancy of the
            dispose of my dear daughter, Alice, in marriage). In this way, I did endeavour to give
            this gentleman encouragement for his great
            pains he took in the family, in teaching
            and instructing and catechising all my children
            and servants at house and church.
         
            I did supply the want of his £40 a year,
            which Mr Bennett gave him for the cure,
             with as much
            out of my own land and gave him many
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.291&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 291</a>





         

         other necessaries he wanted. And afterwards, we prevailed to get the living
            conferred by great solicitation, pains
            and cost by my dear Lord Frescheville's good
            assistance. I procured the presentation
            for him after Mr Bennett's decease.
            
          
    
         
            Nevertheless, I did engage Mr Comber,
            that whenever he should remove hence
            to some other preferment, that he
            should part with this living of Stonegrave
            to my son, Robert Thornton, which would
            be an excellent advantage for his spiritual
            as temporal preferment.
         
            For, as I had begged him of God, so did
            I make it my utmost endeavours to
            have him fixed in so good a station as
            near his own place of birth and his forefathers.</span>  All things then, being acted for
            these holy, pious Christian ends and designs,
            I know not with what face the devil and
            his instruments could devise so many horrid
            lies of a poor creature that made it my
            business to bring up and maintain my children,
            and provide so happily for them all, as in this
            action — I hope, in God — has proved by the great
            mercies of my gracious God and for the good of
            many souls. So that I will rejoice in persecution
            and bless God for the good he has pleased to
            bring out of all my afflictions
            to my poor children.

            Such was 
            Mr Thornton's regard to
            Mr Comber, and to his learning and study,
            that he did give him his diet and lodging
            and horse kept (winter and summer) and was
            ready to do him any good offices, taking
            much delight in his company (notwithstanding all those lies and forgeries, which he
            believed none of them, knowing that his design was to obtain his daughter to be
            his wife).</span> He did abhor all their unjust lies
            which was invented on purpose to break the
            intended match, which they was not ignorant
            of, though they hoped to have broke my heart
            and then have destroyed my children.
          
         
            But blessed be the holy name 
            of God, who
            took the wicked in their own snares, and
            caused them to be ashamed and beg pardon for their sins (many of them being
            now dead and their lives cut off in these sins). 
            I will praise the name of the Lord forever
            and magnify him for his truth and goodness,
            <span class="event" id="ev211-start">
            which did not suffer my dear husband to
            have the least evil thought of me, his true
            servant, but the last journey he ever took
            was to be revenged of old Mr Tancred
            (whose malice was against me because I did
            get that mortgage cleared of Leysthorpe for that
            £100 for Hambleton, which he had got that land
         
         
      <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_two&amp;p0.lo=p.293&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 293</a>





         
            
            
         
            secured to him for it). So, my dear husband
            did intend to have questioned that
               villain for his wickedness against me, his
            innocent faithful wife, as he called me.</span>
            <span class="event" id="evn14-start">
            But, God knows, he, dear soul, had got
            cold in going to Malton at that time,
            and he fell into his palsy fits of which the
            Lord God did take him at Malton.</span> And
            
            I left in a distracted condition by his
            death and more fit to die than live, though
            the Lord has done great things for me his
            desolate widow, and I will praise and glorify
            his name for evermore. Amen.
         
            As to the provision he gave for the
            maintenance and portions of his younger
               brothers and sisters, it may be seen in his
            own account book; having disbursed many
            and constant sums for their maintenance
            and interest, and portions amounting to large
            sums (more than ever my children ever
            had out of their father's estate or any of
            my own portion or fortune, being so disposed
            
            
            of to our ruin). And what was allotted to all
            his brothers' and sisters' portions was £1500 or more,
            so that none could think much what mine — which they
            was to have by Covill's deed — which was the same
            <span class="event" id="ev212-start">
            though they never got any out of the estate, only
            had it send to them
             by the last deed which cost me
            so much sorrow and trouble to get done. This last
            deed of Leysthorpe was dated September 19th,
               1667.
