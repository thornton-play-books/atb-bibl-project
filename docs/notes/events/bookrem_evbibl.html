          bring me into a very great weakness
          and sickness upon the accident of a surfeit
          on some ill digested meat, causing an
           extreme vomiting, whose violence drove
           me into a fever and the measles, which
          brought me so low that my aunt and Sarah
            Tomlinson, our maid, almost despaired
           of my life.

           mercy, upon the hearty prayers and
           requests of my dear aunt, that
           I was spared and, upon the use of good

           God shall spare me so long, to his
           glory and praise even to my life's end,

           our saviour in the Gospel, where he
             was disputing with the doctors with so much
             power that he put them to silence. Upon
           which place in the reading thereof, being
           that day 12 years old, I fell into a deep
           thought of the majesty of Jesus Christ,
           who was able to confound the doctors
          at that age</span>. And then I considered
          my childishness and folly that could not
           scarce understand mean and low things,
          and begged of him to give me knowledge,
           wisdom  and understanding to guide
          and preserve me to my life's end for 
           his mercy's sake. Amen.</span>

         It pleased God to visit my 
          dear and honoured mother, the Lady
          Wandesford, with her last sickness
          upon Friday the 17th
          of November 1659: beginning
           the eighteenth, an exceeding great cough
          tormenting her body by stitches in
          her breast and short breathing;
          these stitches continued about 14
          days, with the cough hindering her from
          almost any sleep. When, upon the
          use of bags with fried oats, butter
          and chamomile chopped laid to her sides,
          the stitches removed, and the cough
          abated as to the extremity thereof.
          But then she was seized with a more
           dangerous symptom of a hard lump
          contracted in her stomach that laid on
          her heart with great pain, and rising
          up to her throat, almost stopping her
          breath when she either swallowed anything or laid to sleep.

         Which lump was conceived to
          be contracted of phlegm and wind
           in the stomach for lack of voidance.
           She had also an exceeding sore 
          throat and mouth, so that she was
          deprived of the benefit to swallow
          almost any kind of food, even
          to a little drop of beer which was,
          for four days or five, the most she 
          took inwardly and that but with
          a syringe. The tongue and mouth
           at first was black, then turned 
          white, so that — with the pains my dear
          mother took in washing and cleansing — the skin came off like a callous
            
          tongue, and was raw and red until the
          blood came, but this continued 
          and in the end grew with a white 
          skin all over.

        In this condition of weakness
          was my dear mother, almost
          quite without food, rest, ease
          or sleep for about a week; in
          which time, as in all her sickness,
          she expressed extraordinary great
          patience, still saying the Lord had
          sent it to her and none could take it
          from her and if he pleased he could ease
          her and that the way to heaven was by the
          gates of hell. She was an example
        and pattern of piety, faith and
          patience in her greatest torment,
          still with godly instructions, gentle
          rebukes for sin, a continual praying of psalms suitable for her
          condition, speaking to God in his own
          phrase and word, saying that we could
          not speak to him from ourselves

         in such acceptable a manner as 
           by that which was dictated by his
        own most Holy Spirit.
           When that any did pray for her,
           she desired they would not pray for
           her life but that these should be
          the heads on which they should petition
          God for her:
       that the Lord would be pleased to
          grant her true and unfeigned repentance
            
          for her sins;
      to give her remission and forgiveness
          through Jesus Christ her saviour; 
          to grant her faith in him, with the 
          sanctification of his Holy Spirit;
          and, at last, to glorify her in heaven, which petitions, said she, 'whosoever shall make for me, the Lord hear
            and grant the same'.

         She had always a great and unfeigned
          love for all God's ministers and often 
          desired their prayers, giving great attention to them, having much comfort
          in her soul after that ordinance.
          Her desire was to receive the Holy Sacrament, which she did with comfort the Thursday
            
          (was seven night before she departed) from
          Mr Peter Samways, although it was with
           great difficulty of swallowing, never 
          tasting dry bread after, for the weakness.
           
          Her desire was to Mr Kearton that he would
          preach her funeral sermon. Text to be
           out of the 14th of Revelation, 13th verse:
          <span class="evquote">'Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord</span>', and so
           to the end.
         This blessed soul had the gift from God
          as to continue, until the last breath, her
          perfect memory, understanding, and
           great wisdom and piety,

         ever recommending her soul with desire to be dissolved and so be with Christ.

          And all the Friday night before she died,
           <span class="evquote">'Come Lord Jesus, come quickly',</span>
           she, making Daphne to pray with her
          the prayer which Dr Smith made in his
           book for a person at the point to die
          and took great notice of each petition,
          praying the same with zeal and earnestness.
      </span><span class="event" id="ev44c-start">  
         About Thursday, at night, she sent
          for her children to take her leave.
          When Mr Thornton and myself came and
          prayed with her, and so took the saddest
          leave of my dear parent as ever
          child could to part with so great 
          a comfort, she praying for us, our

         It pleased God she continued 
          until Saturday, about noon, when
          she spoke to my uncle Norton and recommended her children to his care,
          with much good prayers for him and his,
          then took her leave of him.

         Towards six o'clock at night, her
          speech failed and still she could lift
          up her hands to God. And Daphne 
          prayed her that she would give them some
          sign that she found the comfort of God's
          spirit in her soul,  with a taste of the
          joys of heaven, which she immediately 
          did. And lift up both hands and eyes to
           heaven three times and, closing her eyes
           herself, that sweet saint fell asleep

          following, the 13th of December, in the chiefest
          place in her quire at Catterick church,
           being carried out of her house by
           the Lord Darcy, his son, Mr Conyers,
          Sir Christopher Wyvill and diverse kindred
          of quality. Then, from Hipswell Green,

          my conscience; my sickness and weakness
          threatening my dissolution each minute.
          Yet did I desire to cast myself solely
          at the feet of the most gracious God
          whom I had offended and, though he should
          kill me, yet would I trust in him
          for pardoning and strengthening mercy.
          And it pleased him, in a most wonderful
           manner, to give me some comfort and
          stay, when I was almost past all
          hope, out of that blessed portion of
          scripture which our blessed saviour spoke
           in St Matthew, the 11th chapter
             and 28, verses 29-30, which like lightning pierced into the secret of my heart
          and soul, bringing relief and some hopes of 
           comfort by his sweet and effectual call:
           <span class="evquote">Come unto me, all ye that labour and are
             heavy laden, and I will give you rest</span>.

         I laboured under and was heavy 
           laden 
             with
           
          the burden of my sins
          under the bondage of Satan:
           the one bringing me to slavery; the
          other of shame and torment, persuading me time was past for any help.
           But, lo, <span class="evquote">the lion of the tribe of Judah</span>
          put to flight this prince of darkness
          which deceives the poor, weak Christian,
          making him doubt of that rich goodness
          that is eternally in God as his very 
          being, and at this very time Christ
          Jesus, the righteous, came into my 
           thoughts with <span class="evquote">healing under his wings</span>, 
          making it appear that <span class="evquote">Satan was a
          liar</span>: he calls, he invites, he persuades me to come unto him. He it
          was that give me this scripture to stay
          my drooping heart, even ready to
          faint for want of spiritual food:
          I was weary, and he said 'Come'.

          I was faint and heavy laden.
          He said, <span class="evquote">Come unto me, all ye that labour
           and are heavy laden, and I will give
          you rest</span>. Lord, if thou art pleased
          to call all that are weary, that labour,
           why should not I come? Thou hast
          promised to give me rest: I need it,
          I want it, I cry unto thee out of
          <span class="evquote">the whale's belly of despair</span>. '<span class="evquote">O God,

         desire unfeigned, and hope of thy
           clemency and sweetest mercy that it
          will not be in vain that this thy
          word came into my heart. This was

          unto thee. Thou most sweetly
          calling me at that present when

           consequence to my being, so much
          as my wellbeing and the infant's in 
          my womb. About the May following
            
          the business was this. I had bought 
          six young steers, with some of the monies

          that my dear mother had given
          me before her death which was £150
             
            
          for my own use. Which steers I
          intended for Mr Thornton's draught
          and, in case I should die of that child,
          I made it my desire to Mr Thornton
          that he would pay those monies
          which was agreed upon by my brother
          Denton, which set the price betwixt us
           being £24 for the six steers (I allowing Mr Thornton £4 for the wintering them
           since
           
             Martinmas 1661 
          until May Day). I say
          he promised me to make a bond of
          his own good will to my mother's
           executors for the said money to be
          paid by him at the next Michaelmas 1661,
            but it so happened that Mr Thornton did draw 
            
            the bond for Martinmas
           and not for Michaelmas
            
          as he first intended.

         not refrain from weeping at that
         incident — which I intended for his good — 
          should turn to evil betwixt us.
         But so, it pleased God to suffer Satan to
          tempt (for my greater trial) that
         Mr Thornton was in a very high passion
          against me for that particular mentioned
         and that I should weep, as he said, on purpose
          to shame him (which God knows, it was not

          for the Lord's sake to take heed what
          he did to himself, and that it was the
          devil which tempted him against himself and me to destroy us all; praying
          him to take the goods, I would never
          own any of them rather than he
          should be offended. And begged for Christ's
          sake to put away that evil design,
          and alas, if he should do it, what would
          become of his poor soul more worth

          and my own innocency. Still, I begging
          of God to hinder and prevent anything
          that might hurt him, at last my ever

          was pleased to withdraw my husband's
          passionate hand against himself and
          us, and to appease his anger by degrees.
          But this unhappy accident wrought
          so infinitely with grief upon my heart
          that I fancied I saw the very blood
          upon his penknife and had very near
          gone to make me miscarry at that instant,
          but my merciful God did preserve
          me at that very time from miscarriage

          from his evil intentions and rash act
          against his weak creature, his wife,
          and poor babe in my womb. I confess
           my folly had deserved a great punishment
            
       <span class="event" id="ev51a-start">
          but what had it done that should have suffered with me? Now, lo, the <span class="evquote">Lord God of
          Hosts</span> was at hand to deliver in secret and send help from above. Therefore, praise the great God on high and
           render, <span class="evquote">O my soul, all that is within thee

          forgotten by thee whilst thou lives.
          Yet, it pleased God that this mercy
          should not be forgotten. He did, I believe, set a mark upon my son
          Robert's heart for a note of his deliverance
           at that time. For, when the child was
           born, he had a very strange
         
            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_of_remembrances&amp;p0.lo=p.61&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 61</a>





         
         mark, just upon his heart, of  
          sprinkles of blood, pure and perfectly
          distinct round spots, like as if it had
          been sprinkled upon his skin and the 
          white perfectly appearing betwixt them
          and in the midst thereof, as if it had
          been cut with a knife, a longish cut.
          In this form it continued for half
          a year in its perfect colour, being
           seen oftentimes by myself, Mr Thornton,
           my brother Denton, my two sisters and several others, with the nurse and servants.
          This changed into the shape of a perfect
          heart, all the spots being contracted
          into one, in that form and colour. Then, by
          degrees, grew like a perfect 'T' of the same
          colour and continued so until the child
          was near a year old and then it
           grew bluish and, by little and little, it
           went quite away, and no appearance
          thereof left of it.</span>

         This also must be imputed to the
           goodness of God who would not
          leave such a remark of our offence
          but gently to put us in mind of
          our folly and provocation of his

          received at the hand of God, nor

          to prevent Nettleton from breaking
          up an execution against his estate
          for a debt of my father's (which Mr
          Thornton had been advised by some
          to enter into and to engage for</span>, <span class="event" id="ev53a-start">after he had unfortunately taken upon him the assignment — of my uncle,
             Maulger Norton — of my father's estate
          in Ireland which was to pay his
          debts and portions). A business, which
          I must clear both my dear mother
           and myself from, that we had no hand
           in the least in it to advise him thereto
          which we knew was no way suitable
          neither to his person nor estate, being
          of great trouble and without that which
           my portion — being the pretence for it —
          was undoubtedly safe and secured by
          my father's will (he having at that
           time a lease of land in Kirklington
           
         
            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_of_remembrances&amp;p0.lo=p.65&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 65</a>






            
            
         in possession for the payment of the
           
           English portion of £1500,
            and the will empowering
           my husband for £1000 to be paid out
          of Ireland in its due order).
           </span><span class="event" id="ev53b-start">
          But it so happened that he was advised,
          without our knowledge or consent,
          to engage as formerly mentioned to Nettleton for £900 payable out of his
          own estate (in regard that he would not
          take security out of Ireland) and so
          hotly prosecuted my husband that he
          was forced to procure monies and had
          paid him the £900 and above. Yet, the bond not
          being taken in, he demanded £1000 
           over the statute was for</span><span class="event" id="ev53c-start">and, when Mr Thornton
          was at London, got by some unjust
          means an execution broke up and
           one morning sent his own man, with
          four bailiffs, to seize upon all our goods,
          money, plate et cetera, until he was satisfied.

           At first, they demanded £800 then
          to be paid but at last they fell to
          £200 which they would have or plate
          as much worth. This accident was
          indeed very afflicting to me in that condition, big with child, also knowing
          Mr Thornton went up to prevent the same.
               
            
          It had well-nigh gone near to have
          caused me with grief to have miscarried,
          what for the unjustness thereof and
          disgrace that redounded to us in this
          business. But, as it pleased God,
          there was £100 of Mr Thornton's at that
          time in the house, newly come in, and
          £57 of my own (which my dear mother
          gave me) that stopped their mouths
          at that present, or else it might have
          proved far worse with me at that
          present when they might have

         taken away my bed from under me
           and those quick goods my dear mother
          gave for my relief and children's.  
          These men were very boisterous and
           rude, threatening to take my person
          if not satisfied: lo, in what a
          sad case was I then in? And, but that it
          pleased God to give me relief, I
          had not escaped with my life</span>
          and, by reason that I feared the neglect of
          this business to fall out thus, it did
          somewhat arm me with patience to
          endure it better, having thoughts
          of it before. Thus, have I, upon every
          occasion and act of my life, fresh cause
           to <span class="quote">speak good of the Lord</span>, who, though
          he pleases to <span class="quote">suffer men to afflict

           <span class="quote"> these he gives me strength, and assistance to go through</span>. Therefore, will I

         After this, drawing near a month
           
           of my delivery, it behoved me to
           
          look with a more narrow search into
          my soul and examine how things went
           with me there, whose time of life might
           very probably be very short, this
          being now my seventh child which
          God had given me to conceive. I had
          more strong apprehensions of a change
           in regard it was both my husband's
           mother's number and my own did more
          feelingly work with me. Therefore, 
           as at all times, death waits for us; yet, 
          more usual it is for us to expect
           at these strange and miraculous times —
          especially as they have been to me, more
           than many. Motives I had great plenty
          to examine my own ways by reason
          of my sorrows I had come upon me

          in the whole course of my life, and
          of thankfulness to God for the daily
          renewal of the same.
   
  I found, by sad experiences, that the many
          troubles had fallen upon me of this
          world had diverted my stricter course
          of walking with my God as he had
          required at my hand, and that I had
          many times broken those solemner
    <span class="evquote">vows of baptismal</span> and sacramental too frequently and too often by
          negligence, worldly employments
          and wilful sins. So that I had great
          impulses upon my heart and desires to
          renew this grand ordinance of God,
          and in true and unfeigned repentance, faith,
    hope and charity to be made a partaker
          of this strengthening, this comforting

          and confirming Holy Sacrament, which
           my blessed saviour left us as his 
    dearest pledge of his love, <span class="evquote">who laid
          down his life for sinners</span>, that sinned
            not, <span class="evquote">that became poor that we might
      through his grace be made rich</span>.

        I had not the happy opportunity to receive
            
          this communion but once since my dear
            mother's death, although my soul had
          much longed for it, by reason that the
          ministers on this side had not given
           the same for many years during
          the wars. So that I called to mind that holy
          man, Dr Samways, which did last give
          the sacrament to my blessed mother, and 
          I desired his company to Newton, 
            who accordingly did come and bring 
          my cousin, Benjamin Brown, along. When
          we (with Mr Thornton, my niece, Anne Danby,
         
            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_of_remembrances&amp;p0.lo=p.72&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 72</a>






          
           
         and diverse others) did receive the pledge,
          
          I hope, of our salvation from his hand
          by which I was much comforted and
          helped, enlivened and quickened from
          that black veil and cloud of sin
          that did seem to quite extinguish 
          the hope of my eternal salvation.
      </span>
        
         This most excellent and spiritual
           mercy was not the least but greatest
          I apprehended to receive from God, far
           surpassing all temporals inasmuch
          as eternity does this finite being.
          Oh, that my heart would break in
          pieces at the joyful remembrance of this
          renewing mercy, <span class="quote">wherein God was pleased 
          to become my reconciled God in and through

          I had been unworthy to have

          had left them in an unsettled condition for all that fortune which God

         estate, laden with many burdens,
          and what I could for the satisfaction
          of my own conscience. And blessed

           opportunity for the same.

          yet <span class="quote">hath he not given me over to death</span>
          or despair.
 
         Look, when we were the nearest death, behold
          the goodness of God was entreated for us to
          restore both our lives and let me ever return
          him the glory of his power. And the return of our
           prayers be ascribed to his majesty that immediately gave us a hope of recovery upon
          our calling upon his name: for that very day 
          my husband did miraculously change, and
          each day recovered so fast that it was a wonder
          to all beholders. Oh, what shall I say or do
           to set forth the infinite mercies and  <span class="quote">loving kindness
             of the Lord</span> our God?

         Who still, <span class="quote">in the midst of judgement,
           
           remembers mercies</span> and <span class="quote">shows his compassion</span>
          upon his <span class="quote">poor creatures</span>.
          O Lord God, thou king of glory and power,
           just are thy judgements whether spiritual
           or temporal. <span class="quote">Thou hast chastised me</span> very
          sore and <span class="quote">all thy storms are gone over my
          head</span>, but surely I have offended and done amiss, either in negligence or remissness
          of duties or some other way, or other forgetting thy former deliverances; therefore, hast
           thou seen fit to <span class="quote">correct me</span> in this manner.
          But yet, give me grace to have a sanctified
          use of this affliction upon our bodies and
          grant that this  may be for the good and
          profit of our souls, and that I may say <span class="quote">it is
          good for me to be afflicted</span>. <span class="quote">Grant that I may
           receive instruction</span> to my soul and <span class="quote">that thy
          loving correction</span> may make me humble
          and thankful. I here, from the bottom of my
           unfeigned soul and heart, <span class="quote">lift up my voice</span>
         
            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_of_remembrances&amp;p0.lo=p.97&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 97</a>






           
          to adore, and praise, and <span class="quote">magnify thy great
           
            and glorious name</span>. Thou, O Lord, art holy;
          thou art just, wise, omnipotent, almighty
          and infinitely full of compassions towards
          thy frail creatures. <span class="quote">We sin and thou chastiseth us into obedience</span>: if thy mercy will
            not move, <span class="quote">thy rod must correct</span>. Oh, let
          us not forget or slight this deliverance
          to us both. But, more especially, let it
           never slip out of my mind but <span class="quote">write this
             upon the table of my heart:</span> that the Lord has
            added this new life of my husband's
          at my humble request and given us both
          fresh and eminent cause of gratitude to
          his majesty. To thee, O Lord, Holy Trinity,
          do I dedicate my soul and all its faculties
          to be a <span class="quote">sacrifice of praise</span>. Let me not fall
          into any sins to offend or displease so loving
           a father who <span class="quote">did not cast me away</span> in
           distress. Blessed be the name of our redeemer,
           by <span class="quote">whose intercession</span> and passion I obtain this
           mercy, even forever and ever. Amen.

          While I am in this <span class="quote">body of death</span>,
           I find by sad experience that, as my days
          increase, so will sin grow up too rife in
          these corruptions. I have tasted of the great
          and unlimited mercies and clemency of the
           great God of heaven, the <span class="quote">Lord most
             high</span> <span class="quote">and, likewise, been under manifold
            trials, sorrows, troubles and afflictions,
            both as to spirit and body.</span>
         But, as when the hand of God is upon us, we
           are apt to be more discomforted and sad, so should 
           I — and do desire to — make it my utmost
          endeavour to inquire what is it that God
           aims at by all his providences and dealings.
          I find my heart too apt to forget what a
          low condition I was brought into by sickness
           and Satan, either as to Mr Thornton's or my
          own trials. And peradventure hath not
          rendered him that due praise for all our exceeding 
          deliverances that he hath vouchsafed to me in
             particular or him, 
         
            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_of_remembrances&amp;p0.lo=p.99&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 99</a>






             
          or sure for some other punishment of  
           
           my negligent soul is the Lord's hand stretched
          out still, and which by a late cross he hath
           showed his anger against me. <span class="quote">Shall I receive
          good at the hand of God and not render him the
           glory, or shall I receive corrections from the same
             hand</span> and still be insensible thereof (God
           forbid) why or wherefore he thus deals
          with me?
         It was his infinite goodness in giving me
           this sweet infant, in giving her the 
           blessed opportunity of holy baptism. <span class="quote">And
          is the mercy the less in that he has pleased
          to deprive me of its enjoyment any longer
          or by the prevention of actual sin in her?</span>
          Oh no: I humbly acknowledge all these his
          mercies and give him the glory due to him therein.
          My sins was ripe for punishment, and he
           pleased thus it should be to teach me by
          his rod and staff to approve myself an
           obedient child to so good, so great, so loving
           a Father.

           I dare not, I will not repine at this 
          most gracious chastisement. It may seem
           a little troublesome to part with my sucking
          child from my breast for the present, <span class="quote">and surely
           the hand of God is in it for my punishment,
          but good is the  will of the Lord.</span> Is it not good
          inasmuch as he hath spared me still to
           repent, who is the vilest, the meanest and unprofitable worm upon earth, and given me
          still the lives and comforts of my dear husband
           and three children?
      
      As to temporals this is exceedingly much more
          than I could have expected and, therefore, will
          I praise the Lord our God. 
      But for spiritual mercies, such have those
        been in an infinite measure showered down on
        my head <span class="quote">that I am not able to enumerate
          nor tell them, neither can my tongue or heart express them</span>.
         But, <span class="quote">to the glory of thy holy name</span>, do I ascribe
          <span class="quote">the honour of my creation, the inestimable mercy</span>

          Holy be the Lord most high and glory to

             with sickness.
          But we used what means could be to so
          young a child, yet nothing was effectual,

         She continued with some intermissions

    with floods by intermission a day or two

         The 5th of January 1667: my dear
          Robin Thornton began his sickness of the
           smallpox, being very ill and weak for  
           two days; and the seventh, eighth, ninth days he was in
          great danger of death, they not coming
          well out until the tenth day (on which day he
          lost his sight by them, which was come out
           very much and was great ones); on the fourteenth) his
          fever and disease was at the height.

         About the fifteenth, he began to alter for
          the better so that a change was discerned;
           seventeenth he began to see again; eighteenth,
            he  perfectly 
          recovered his sight and recovered very
          fast. For which I most humbly bless and
          glorify our gracious God with all my soul
          and magnify his mercies to me in the deliverance of this my dear and sweet
          child from death and giving him as a blessing to his father and mother, and not <span class="evquote">quenching my coal</span> in this family. Oh, praise
          the Lord, O my soul and <span class="evquote">forget not this

         Twenty-fourth: Robin first got up, and on his feet
           and was perfectly well, growing daily strong,
           and was not disfigured at all with the smallpox. Only he never since recovered his
           sweet and beautiful favour and pure
           colour in his cheeks, but his face drew
           longer than before. Nor did his hair
           come off at all, having but few in
           his head, but the most was in his face.
           He wanted nine months of being five 
           years old and some odd days.</span>

           but on the twenty-ninth, it pleased the most good
          and gracious God, did begin to give better 
          hopes, the pox coming well out, and she in
          a warmer temper was not so sick, so that
          by mercy we hoped for her recovery.
           The thirty-first, she fell blind and had intermitting

          well until the 6th of February. And being very sore

          strait throat, getting very little sleep
          until the 3rd of February when she began to sleep;

           her eyes began to unclose; the fifth, she
          did see perfectly, and they began to blacken
          and  ripe, and her throat was pretty well,
          her fever did abate; eighth, she began to be
           pretty well and strong. The eighteenth, Nally rose out
          of her bed and recovered very fast, growing
          strong by degrees. She had very many

          extreme violent pain of the teeth —
          did bring me into that weakness that I
          could neither stand nor go for

         After which recovery of my health,
          I was very much in affliction about
          my dear husband's illness and often
          relapses into his former paralytic
          fits, which fell on him notwithstanding
          all the many remedies was perpetually
          used by Dr Wittie's order and with good
           success. So that, from 
           
           November 1667 until
          August 1668, he had not missed one fortnight from a relapse or the degrees of 
          it; insomuch that I never enjoyed any comfort in consideration  and fear of him
          and his sufferings, and lest I should be deprived of my joy and delight in this life.
          Though, I bless God, he had intermissions
           which supported him after every use of physic 
          and other things and, according to the earliness
          of the time in beginning them, the fits was longer

        day. For his sister, Kate, and cousin, Willy
          Denton,  and himself was playing
           in the hay lathe at Newton upon the mow 
          and, standing in the window about four yards

          dawning hopes of his grace in his heart,
          which appears in his being afflicted with
             good instructions when given him
          and his desire to be informed of all things
          concerning God, and several notions of the
          fear of the Lord upon hearing his judgements
          with many Christian and pathetical expressions in the ways of piety. All which are
           motives of great comfort to me, his poor

          chamber which was to my aunt's great grief and
          trouble to hear. And by which malicious repetition to her and renewing the wounds afresh
           of calumnies, I fell into a very grievous
           extremity of grief again upon the 5th
            
             of September, which so affected my soul that did
          raise both the spleen and mother in my
           sides, both together with much pain and trouble.
           And had I not been held on my sides by my dear
           cousin, Christopher Norton, and comforted by my
            aunt's wise and discreet and affectionate kindness,
          I had undoubtedly perished with that heavy
          load of 
        [heart]
     grief and sorrow that such treacherous practices of subtlety and dissembling
          should be the ruin of my life and that honour 
          which was unspotted in my life and conversation.</span><span class="quote">But, blessed be my gracious God and Father of all

           soul but — through some's deep plots

          And it set his

     against such, and did further
          both lament my condition, condole the same
          and took my part against all those vile

         And to this main pillar of help and
          comfort to support my fainting, weak
           body, I had given me, through mercy, the
          cordial and entire affection and assistance of
          my dearest aunt Norton, whose candour
          and goodness did extend its arms to pity
          my distresses and to whom I had imparted
          my sorrows and distress. And she so ordered
          this business in wisdom that she delivered
          me from the pressures that then laid upon my
          injured person, which almost pressed me
          to the death, and added many circumstances
          to my succour that I should not have had by
          any other in the world. Therefore, <span class="quote">will I praise

          of all manner of troubles and sorrows
          almost ever since I entered into the

          husband's falling sick at Malton
          brought to me by a letter to my brother
          Denton, which did so suddenly surprise
          my spirit that I fell to tremble exceedingly with great grief and fears upon
          me for his safety and life. Immediately,
          I sent for Dr Wittie to go to Malton
          and sent each day to see my dear and
          only joy and comfort, but myself so
          much afflicted that I went presently to
          bed and continued with the break, and then I
           was in danger of overflow because of
          my excessive sorrow: only the Lord did
          <span class="evquote">support my soul from sinking</span>. On Wednesday, I sent my brother Denton and Mr
          Comber to my joy at Malton and longing
           all the day to hear from him and, if I could
          without loss of my poor and miserable life,
          I would have gone to have seen him myself
          but my friends would not suffer me to make
          an adventure thereof. But I stayed until

          night, when word was brought from Dr 
          Wittie that I should be of good cheer for I
          should have my dear heart home as well
          to me as ever I had him in my life. So that
          I did shore up my hopes in God and pour 
          out my tears and prayers in abundance that
           night for the life and health of dear husband
          with me (if it did stand good with the will and
          pleasure of our God) and got some little slumbers,
          though with fears and tremblings, and sad and dismal dreams. When, in the morning, my brother Denton came home and very discreetly
          prepared me, with good advice and counsel, to
          entertain the Lord's determinate will in all
          things with patience and submission if the worst
          should fall on me according to my fears,
          but withal God could raise him up again
          if he see it fit, although my dear 
        [heart]
    
           was very weak. At which news, I grew
           very ill — and the Lord pardon my weakness for
           it — with a renewing of my great sorrows for the
          being fearful to be deprived of this my sole
          delight in this world next under my good
           God.

          So, betwixt hopes and fears, I rested
          until the next messenger came, which was
          about four o'clock on Thursday in the
          afternoon: at which time I received the
          news of the most terrible loss that ever
          woman lost in being deprived of my
           sweet and most

           Such was
          my extremity of passion and trouble
          upon this change that I was almost 
          changed into nothing and was ready
          to go into the grave with him whom God
          had joined me
            to almost 17 years. Great
            
          are the sorrows of my 
        [heart]
     and many 
           storms have gone over my soul,
          but this is  the <span class="quote">Lord's sharpest arrow</span>
          that is gone out against me. Now am I
           left destitute of head, guide, help
          or support in this world, tossed with all

          broken in upon me like a mighty water</span>

          sadnesses. We walked together as dear
           friends: his love was mine; in his sickness,
          I was afflicted. Now am I left of him
           who was my earthly delight. He, being
          gone to his heavenly Father and left
          me to lament his loss from me and my
           poor, <span class="quote">fatherless children</span>: weak in
           body, afflicted in spirit, low in my
           estate, losses of my dearest friends
          and relations and children, and other comforts
           as dear; and now, to consummate my sufferings, my husband withdrawn. Oh,
          that my sorrows were weighed and that the

          My dear husband, William Thornton

          on Friday the 11th of September 1668 and
          was much as he used to be of late, pretty
          well of his infirmity; went to Malton Hill
          on the next day and to church on Sunday.

          Sinclair. And told him that he knew that formerly
          he had been in much trouble of mind and
          sadness for his sins and had walked uncomfortably for the want of the sense of
          God's favour and in great fears and horrors,
          but now the Lord was pleased to make himself known to him to be a <span class="evquote">reconciled

            with him</span> and did feel a great deal of
          joy and comfort inwardly in his soul

          his infinite mercies and hoped that he should
          bless his name for evermore that he was 
          troubled; for now he was  reconciled to

          was dispatch for immediately and came
          to him on Wednesday, after dinner from
          York (Dr Wittie). He was at that time
          very weak in body but, I bless God,
          perfect in his understanding. And, having

          hair cut off by the doctor's order (being the
          latest remedy) with his own free consent.

           in her arms. I fell upon the corner of the
           hearthstone in the passage chamber going into 
          my dear mother's chamber. The wound so deep
          that my mother saw the skin of the brain when
           the skull was broken and had gone nigh
           to have 
          killed me.</span> But ever blessed be the name of my

          She had one also not long before my Lord 
          of Strafford and the holy king suffered, which she
          told me often of, and before the Scotch rebellion
           and that of Ireland most dreadful to her.

         She did see in the north window, in her
          chamber, the sky broke out and opened with a
          dreadful noise, and like guns and swords to
          war. When followed an infinite number
          of people, like common people and meaner
           sort,
          with raw-boned faces like Scots and Irish and
          English, all in a great confusion and hurry,
          as if running with arms and a posture of
          fighting and other instruments of war. These
          came before with loud clamours and shouts and
           noise. Then, a little distance after, came
          my Lord of Strafford, the Lord Lieutenant
           of Ireland, in mourning habit and, most
          sad and pensive, walked at a space by himself first, and then appeared as without a
          head. After him, the Bishop of Canterbury so also.
          After my Lord, at a good pretty distance,
          appeared the perfect person of the good
           King Charles I with the crown on his
          head but, being pursued, he looked back
          in a dread fright going fast on before. And
          having his sword drawn in one hand and
          the other arm he held over the young 
          Prince Charles in defending and preserving
          him  from the multitude, and this in a
          great concern. And seemed to fly and, having
          his robes and crown on his head,

         then pursued an infinite, innumerable
          company and multitude of all sorts of men,
           and in so terrible and dreadful a manner that
          it affrighted my dear mother very much, and in
          pursuance of the king to take him. All
           the while of this appearance, loud noise
          and shouts and rude tumults in great
          horror with arms and guns. And all the
          while this appeared (which was so distinct
          and perfect that she did believe she really saw
          the real sight) the sky was so clear and
           at noontime of day which lasted about
           an hour or more to her very great
          fear and affrightment.</span>

         Within a little while, my father came
          up into the chamber to see her. When she,
          being extremely troubled, told him this thing,
          he heard her with patience. And when she
          asked him what he thought of this great
          sight, he would not show to her his trouble,
          but said dreams was not to be believed
          but bid her  refer all to the divine
          providence. Yet he was observed to be 
          very sad. And after, and before this, said
          that there was a dreadful cloud hung

over these churches and nations which she
           would live to see. But, as for his part, he
          did believe he
          should not live to see them,
          but most Christian-like begged of God to
          prevent and hinder those calamities to
          fall on the church and kingdoms, and prayed
           heartily for our good king, said that 'pride and
          fullness of bread would be the fall of the
          church and state if God prevented not',
          with many other like prophetical sayings,
           several times, with much trouble and sorrow
          still begging to God to divert his judgement.

           pity me in particular, saying with a sigh,
          'Ah, poor child, what miseries must thou live
          to see?' And with a groan, turned him about,
          which pity of my dear father and his earnest look
          did never go out of my

          immediately before my dear sister Danby died.
          I did see her laid on the childbed, all in white
          and as if she were asleep: coming to her,
          looked within the curtains, but she appeared to me
           to be dead at which I cried out,

          being much affrighted, and said she was
          really dead. And there I awaked in grief.

           <span class="event" id="ev100a-start">
           Within a little space, she fell into labour
          of Frank, her 19th child, and sent for my
          mother and myself to Hipswell. I, going to
           her, did find her laid on a couch like to
          my dream which did amaze me. Yet, she
          lived to bring forth that son in infinite extremity and quite different from all the other
           (the child coming double, with his buttocks
          all the way) and so exquisite torments to
          that poor soul, which was not at all like as
           in her other childbed, getting no sleep at
          all for 12 nights.</span> <span class="event" id="ev100b-start">But, one day when
          Aunt Norton was there, she fell into a slumber
          a little while, then started out of it. And
           told my aunt, 'I have had the strangest dream 
          that ever I had. I dreamt that a man came into the room with all things for mournings
           and laid them on the ground. And B. W. habits
           and sleeves, et cetera', I said. She asked what that meant.
           
           The man that brought the mournings, said that,
          when such things appeared in a child wife's

          'Is not this an odd dream?' My aunt Norton said
          to her that dreams was but fables not to believed.
          Then my sister replied, '<span class="evquote">God's will be done</span>'. She desired
          to die and be with Christ, which was best of all: which
           within a month's space she died, having suffered many
          sorrows and troubles through which I hope she entered into
          the kingdom of God.</span> Amen.

         I had a sad dream half a year before my
          brother, George Wandesford, was lost. That he was
           going over this river and that it did rise then
           when he was in it, which so overcame him that he
          could make no help for himself and so was
          drowned in it. This dream did trouble me much
           and I waked in grief but, seeing it but a dream,
           I prayed it might never come to pass and fell asleep again. And dreamt the second time the same,
           which wakened me in much grief and fear, falling into
           a great sorrow and trembling until the morning.
         
           And then I was in trouble when my dear brother,
             George, came into the chamber and asked me what made
          me weep so sore. I answered it was for him. 'Why', said
          he, 'sister dost thou weep for me?' I said because he
          was so venturous to go over that dangerous river
          Swale and that I feared he might be lost in it. And
          begged of him, for God's sake, that he would not presume to
          go so when it was high, for I feared him much that
          a flood should destroy him; for I had had a dreadful
           dream that night concerning it and told him all the
              circumstances of it.

        At which he gave a sigh and said, for my sake,
          he would not venture again but have a care
          of himself, and gave me his hand he would not go
           over it again when it was high, which pleased me
          to hear this resolution.
      Nor did he ever until that
          day of his death go that way after, and then
           was compelled to it by reason of shortness of time.
           It was on Easter Monday, when he came from Mr
          Darcy's (Henry):</span> 
           <span class="event" id="ev101c-start">he, having the Easter Day, by God's
           mercy, been prepared to receive the Holy Sacrament
          and to my great joy did take it with my dear mother
          and myself and my brother, Christopher. One thing 
           must not be forgotten. That there had been a great
          falling out betwixt George Wandesford and Christopher Wandesford, my brothers, about
          the menservants, that made debate amongst them
           so that they would not have received that holy feast.
           But it pleased God to give me that blessing that I did
          use all my utmost endeavours to reconcile them
           by all Christian persuasion, which I humbly praise God
          for I did at that time. And they were in perfect charity
          each to other and did both receive very reverently
           on Easter Day in Hipswell Chapel with my dear mother
           and myself.

          But, in the afternoon, my brother
          George Wandesford did go to see Mr Henry Darcy and, finding
            
           him not at home, entertained himself with old mother 
             Darcy. And he took a Bible and read a chapter to her,
          and did make such an admirable exposition on it

          that she protested she did never hear the like.
          At which she admired, and said, 'Sir, I ever took you
           to be a fine gentleman and well-bred, but I did
           not think you had been so good a scholar and a divine'. 
          At which my dear brother answered with a deep sigh, and
          said, 'Ah, Mrs Darcy, I have had the best advantage 
           of a religious education and piety by my dear
          parents as any man living, and has understood
           my duty to God, et cetera, but God knows such has been
          my troubles and vexations of the world, and the
          madness of my enemies against me that I have
          not followed what I should but been extravagant
            more than I would. But, if it please God to bless
           me with life, <span class="evquote">you shall see me become a new
          man by his grace</span>, and I will set myself to do
          glory to God and good in my country. The Lord forgive
          me what is past, and I will forsake what is amiss',
          which words, she said, proceeded with great earnestness
          and was a great joy to her to hear them. But the Lord
          was not pleased to grant him a long life but to take
          him away in these good designs. And what he wanted
          in power, God accepted in the will in him.

           He laid that night there 
           and the next morning 
          came to Hipswell about nine o'clock, and at that time
           found me in a most sad circumstance. I had been
          combing my head and, on a sudden, there was a
          most grievous pain struck into my sinews of
           my neck, which was so intolerable that

          I could not hold my tongue from crying out
          nor to hold my neck straight (it being so
           much contracted in the main sinews) but
          was tormented for an hour together. At
          which time, my brother came into the chamber and,
          kneeling down very reverently, asked
          blessing. Then came to me in a fright, asked me what
          ailed me to cry so grievously out. 'Oh', said I,
          'dear brother, I am in greater torment than I
          could express'. All did amaze at this but
          thought it to be cold and he had pity on me, Lord

           in great haste to write to London to Mr Richard Darley

          write. She said that I was so gravely ill she could
          not leave me but do it afterwards. So, he did
          again kneel down and ask blessing. She said,
           'Son, you asked blessing but another you came in'.
          He said that he could not have too much of her prayers
          for him, and so reverently bid her good morrow
          and me farewell. And took horse to go to Richmond .</span>

           the sum of £7000. But though she did

          received it but would not give up
          his bond and statute without the payment
          of it. But I was so terrified at a
          suit that I told my dear husband
          it was best to borrow and pay it that we
           might get quit of him. But my dear
             husband would not, but said that he

         But, when he was gone to London,

          bailiff was come to distrain all my
          goods for that debt and put me into a

           asked who had been here. I said none, 
          for she locked me  in.
         
         At last, she said they was there, but prayed
           me not to be frighted for they was civil.
          I said, 'Sir Wandesford should pay it'. But they
          would not go without the money; so it was
           much grief to me, though I had been lost if
          I had not had the dream beforehand.
          I bless the Lord, my God, for my delivery
           from death and miscarriage of my dear
            child. But I, by providence, had
           received 
             £100 of my portion that week, and had

         that £58 was my dear mother's that
          I had in the house, which I paid to them
          and so they got £158 of me that time,
