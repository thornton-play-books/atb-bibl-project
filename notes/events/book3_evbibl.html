            great Creator, holy God of love,By whom I now do live and breathe, and moveWhile
        
            in this darksome cell of earth.
         Thou givest me time and power, and space to breatheRich gifts and faculties of soul and spirit,To fit us for thy holy place to inherit.For which thy gracious goodness did designTo us, poorest
            mortals, by thy love, divine.

          stand,
         
            I beseech thee, O Lord, to grant my poor request:
         That I may now live out all the rest
            Of this, my weary pilgrimage,
            and not

          I, having now passed through the two stages of my life 
        of my virgin estate and that of the <span class="quote">honourable estate 
            of marriage</span> as St Paul terms it, though <span class="quote">with much troubles 
            in the flesh</span>, the same has had its comforts allayed to me. 
          <span class="quote">Yet have I great cause to render most humble thanks 
        to the great God of heaven for his infinite and inexpressible 
           favours towards me</span>, <span class="quote">who has mixed his frowns with smiles; 
           his afflictions, with comforts and so ordered his visitations as 
        to make a way for me to escape</span>. And bestowed on me that 
        great blessing, above many others, of a dear and pious, virtuous
        and chaste husband, with whom I lived and enjoyed his 
        endeared and faithful affection in the bond of a holy marriage 
        without the least taint of our conjugal vow, but our faith
            
           and holy tie most sacredly and inviolably kept to each other
           (as I may justly avouch who am now left <span class="quote">the most desolate 
        and forlorn widow</span> in the world by this separation of so dear a 
          husband). But who may say to the Lord, 'what doest thou?', since 
           

               <span class="quote">the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh: blessed be the name of the Lord</span>.
         

          
            
           He pleased to lend me his life, though mixed comforts 
           with many tribulations of this temporal (evils falling upon our own 
           persons, posterity and estate, which made enjoyments bitter to us).
         

         
           Yet, while we enjoyed each other's love — and endeared, candid love — 
        so entirely to each other, with the benefit of Christian piety and religion, 
        it did sweeten our temporal troubles to us and made us value
             this 
           world but as a troublesome passage into a better. And God thereby 
           these, his dispensations, so wisely framed and moulded us in the <span class="quote">furnace 
        of afflictions</span>, drew our hearts to him and there fixed <span class="quote">our anchor of 
           hope</span> that, after this miserable life ended, we shall enjoy each other 
           in a glorious eternity. And often would my blessed husband say, 
           'My dear, oh, that thee and I, and all our dear children were now all with 
        God'. Nor could I be blamed to wish the same and pray for it, if it 
        might be good in the sight of our gracious Father in heaven who
           made and preserved us to this time of our days. And, I hoped, in his 


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.23&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 23</a>






           due time — after a few days here spent in his service and doing 
        his work which he has appointed us to do — we shall enjoy the same.
           
        
        
          But, as to the set time of our departure, we dare not appoint it
        
              to him but submissively wait his divine pleasure, both when and the 
               circumstance of our abode and of our work, and also endeavour to be ready
          for him at his call.
         

          

              Often would my dear husband give a check to my great 
              and unreasonable desire and passion of grief for him, when I have
              been ready to die with grief for fear of losing my chiefest joy by his 
           death, gently reproving my too much doting on him,


               

         
        
           told me: I loved him more than I ought; should love no 
           creature so but God; wishing me to submit to his pleasure and part 
        freely with him to God if he called for him. For he prayed that I might 
        be preserved and spared for his children's good, and that I might do them more 
        good than he could do, and hoped I might outlive him and be a comfort
        
           to them. Yet, I was not of that opinion or desire but begged rather
            to go before him.
         

          
           But that God, <span class="quote">the wise disposer of all</span>, so ordered in his pleasure to
            continue me yet in the <span class="quote">land of the living</span>, and gave me <span class="quote">a bitter cup to
           drink</span>, both in his death and after it, which I humbly beseech him (in great
              mercy to his faithful servant and widow) to sanctify to me, and to <span class="quote">enable
            me to bear the cross of my dear saviour</span> with that measure <span class="quote">of patience,
                  
            humility, submission, resignation and all other gifts and graces of his Holy
           Spirit</span> that I may be enabled to bring up those children left with me.

          
           And to perform all my duty to God and man as <span class="quote">a faithful steward</span> 
           of what he has vouchsafed to entrust me withal, that so by his grace 
        I may be assisted and upholden. And
         
         
           that in thy sight, O Lord, my God, grant that I may there take sanctuary
           
           from all my sins, which is the cause of my suffering. And, O my God, I 
           beseech thee, give me succour and support under all my calamities that my
              soul faint not before thou deliver me.
         

          

              For I am poor, despised and distressed, slandered and abused for doing
           my duty, and serving thee in my calling in thy holy church and bringing up my
              children in thy holy faith and fear. All thy storms has gone over me and <span class="quote">I am
           desolate and forlorn</span>, without comfort in this world; only in thee, O God, have I hope.

          Grant that my soul may not faint or despair, for I am feeble and
           sore smitten. Oh, help me now, O my gracious God, who has so often delivered me out of many deaths and brought me to be a widow, and so in a
        more peculiar property to be relieved; <span class="quote">for thou art the father of the fatherless
          and husband to the widow</span>; a friend to the <span class="quote">friendless</span>, orphan and <span class="quote">stranger</span>.
        I have no strength against my spiritual enemies but only in thy
         mercies and sweetest clemencies.

          O dearest Jesus, preserve my precious soul who thou did
            <span class="quote">redeem with thy precious blood</span>. Oh, deliver me from that
            destruction, which hell and Satan has prepared for me at this

            me not over into the will of my secret or open enemies who, on
            no occasion, make them ready to battle and to devour that small
          pittance thou hast left me to pay debts, live on and bring up my
          children; then shall I rejoice in thy name, when thou shalt
          deliver my eyes from tears and my feet from falling into
          spiritual or temporal destruction.
         
           <span class="quote">For vain is the help of man</span>, but in thee — <span class="quote">the God of mercies</span> — the
           fatherless, widow, friendless findeth mercies. O my God, my

           so will I bless and praise and glorify thy name forever. Amen.

           At the time of my dear husband's decease, it pleased
           God to spare my life to live to see (through many tribulations,
           sorrows, trials, dangers and deliverances) the 41st year of my 
           age and seven months. <span class="event" id="ev3-start">I, being born at Kirklington, February 13, 1626,</span> 

           so that in February 13, 1668, I completed the age of 42nd 
           years of my miserable life, when I fell in to my widowed condition,
           
           
           <span class="event" id="ev4-start">
           and lived in the state of marriage since December 15, 1651
           until September 17, 1668.

         
          
           The number of my years in the married estate of my life
           was 16 years and nine months and two days 
              which I lived in this honourable but troubled estate of life (St <span class="evquote">Paul</span>).
         </span>
        
        
              What sorrows and afflictions it pleased my God to lay 
          upon me in that time were very many, but I could have been 
          willing to have undergone them all with pleasure if I might have 
          enjoyed still the comfort of my dear husband's life and health.
           But I was not worthy of so great a mercy — he being prepared 
          for a better place to enjoy his God in glory when he laid down his this 
          body — or can I sufficiently bless my God, who gave him to me and continued him so long in this mortal life to be an example to 
          this world of his great virtues. And pray that his posterity may 
          follow the same.
      

      
         
        The age of my only son remaining to me 
        of four, which the Lord gave me, was at his father's decease, September 19, 1668,

          (being the day of his father's burial) that day was the
        birthday of my dear son, Robert Thornton, in which he obtained
          the age of six years. <span class="event" id="ev5-start">He being born on September the 19th, 1662,
        he was — that very fatal day to me, of his father's burial  — the

            sixth year of his life. Being observed to be a very remarkable 
        circumstance; that his dear father, who had rejoiced so
        much at his son's birth, should make his exit that day six years,</span>

           his only son (whom he had begged of God to continue his family)
           to be brought up. But left him (so young) to my poor endeavours 
            
              and care, who was overcharged with greater sorrows and burdens
           upon my weak and sick condition, and at that time overwhelmed with
              sufferings of all kinds imaginable could fall upon <span class="quote">a desolate

           <span class="event" id="ev9-start">I being — at and before the death of my dear husband — 
           fallen into a very great and dangerous condition of sickness,
         
              weakness of body and afflicted mind on the account of my evil
           enemies' slanders with excess of grief thereon (as related by me 
           in my 'First Book' more at large)
          </span>
          
           <span class="event" id="ev10-start">
           was reduced to a very weak and fainting extremity when
            I had 
          that sad news of his departure brought from Malton, which did
          extremely heighten and aggravate my sorrows, both in respect of 
           his sudden loss — when I expected him home — and of my own great 
          faintings. And was most desirous to have gone with him to the grave,

        
           so that none did expect my life to be continued after him, 
          and all my friends used utmost endeavours
             to administer some 
          comfort in this sad condition with persuading arguments.
        </span>
           
         
     
      
           
       
           First, that — as to the slanders so cruelly and inhumanely raised on me —
       I had the testimony of a clear conscience (both before God and man)
       of my innocency and confirmed by an unspotted, virtuous life, I had

            given the world testimony of in all my life and conversation.

        

          
          
    
    <span class="event" id="ev11-start">
          And that I might be assured in all passages and on all occasions, 
          I was so clearly vindicated by my dear husband's faithful 
           and tender dear expressions, and constant zealous belief and affection 
         
           towards me, and assurance of my faithful and entire conjugal fidelity
              of me, insomuch that he declared to my aunt Norton and to
           my brother Denton — upon my bitter cries to stay him from going to
           Malton for fear he should fall into a fit of the palsy —
         

         
           he declared to them that he was much troubled to leave me
           in that weak condition I, then, was in by those slanders. But that as he

          knew best my fidelity towards him and virtue all my days, so he
          could not be satisfied in his own conscience until he had vindicated 
           my cause and righted me against that abominable beast, Mr Tancred, 
           who envied anyone's chastity but was always an enemy to his family 
          
           before I came into it and so, out of malice, had injured me for his
           sake. He then did protest he went on no other business but that 
           and was resolved to be revenged of him for it. But charged them not 

tell me of it for the grief would kill his most chaste and dear wife.
           </span>
         

         
           This account of so great and signal affection of my ever-dear 
           husband can never be forgot, nor buried in oblivion, whose 
           honest integrity — to me and his children showed in so remarkable 
           and public a manner — did evidence the truth to the whole world.

           Besides, he knew the fears I had upon me all along since 
          he fell down into his fit of palsy, and my own great apprehension of his death to fall suddenly — as also, my own great illness 
           and many weakness on myself upon every such fit — did press 
           much upon my spirit; lest we both should be snatched from 
          our dear children, and they left in a forlorn condition of both their
          parents gone and solely left orphans. 
         

           
              
           <span class="event" id="ev12-start">
           This consideration did move us to accept of the motion to
              dispose of our eldest daughter in marriage — when she attained
           some years fit for that change — unto Mr Thomas Comber, then
              minister of Stonegrave, who my dear husband deemed to be a
              man of great abilities, learning and parts, and in his own phrase did
           say, if he lived 'would be a very great man in the church', and he
          believed would be a bishop before he died.
         

         
           
           These things encouraged Mr Thornton and myself to go on
         
           with this motion and did consent to it and made several articles
           of agreement concerning the same with Mr Thomas Comber (before
           my husband's death, with good satisfaction to my dear husband, 
                  my daughter and myself).
          

          
            But this affair was not to be managed publicly — for many
            reasons betwixt my husband and myself — until further opportunity.

            And he, well knowing this design, could not be blamed to be so
              earnest and zealous in the vindication of my wronged honour and
            abused innocency by such slanderous and viperous malicious tongues.</span>
        

        
         
           
          
          <span class="event" id="ev13-start">
           The consideration of these arguments used
            by my friends to comfort
         

               me did avail towards some moderation of my grief for those wicked
           practices, being joined to the examination of those people in the house
           (which had heard malicious speeches) before my brother Denton and Mr Thornton,
               who utterly denied on oath that they had ever seen or heard from me
           in their lives any evil, or what they falsely objected to them, lamenting much
           that they had not told of it before that it might have been punished.
           And that they never believed any ill of me, who hated anything of
               that kind in all and ever given them good counsel and example.</span>
        

          But the sad dispensation of my dear husband's death at this
           juncture of time, and his great and inexpressible love for me (as before
          expressed) to lose him now did aggravate my sorrows extremely, as it
          heightened my love and honour
             for his memory.

           But thou, O Lord, my God, who seest my sorrows and
              my sufferings of all kinds, and knowest the cause of thy

             thee to pity and pardon all
           things amiss — in myself or husband in thy pure eyes — which did
          provoke thy displeasure against us and has cut off the thread

           <span class="quote">opened the mouths of my enemies against me to dishonour

          shall no man be justified</span> by any righteousness of his own.
        
           Yet, since thou hast seen the integrity of my heart to
          do my duty in my relations and serve thee in this station as well
           as I could — to provide for my husband's children and family, the
           establishment of it in thy faith and truth of thy gospel, with
           an honest care had of <span class="quote">the children of my bowels</span> which thou hast
           spared with life to thy handmaid —
        
           oh, depart not from me or mine but graciously defend
           and deliver me, thy widow, <span class="quote">out of this snare which Satan has
           laid for me to cause me to despair</span>. Defend my cause, I beseech
           thee, O Lord, and make <span class="quote">my enemies ashamed and repent of all their
           wickedness</span>, and stop their lying mouths which blaspheme my honour,
            
          making my innocency to appear <span class="quote">by thy providence</span> over
          all my actions, and bring to pass all those good ends which thy servants
            
           hoped for and let me be delivered and preserved in soul and body at
           all times. In this, my weaknesses, let thy healing hand appear,
        
           giving me sufficient grace and strength and provision for my three
             poor children — that <span class="quote">for Jesus Christ, his sake</span>, who hath loved
           me and given himself for me — that I and the children thou has
           given me may <span class="quote">be a generation said by the Lord to glorify thy

          my conscience) which drew me into inevitable afflictions and daily
           sorrows after I departed from my mother's house and my aunt
            Norton's family after her decease.
         
           So that I had not for two years afterward the benefit
           or satisfaction of receiving the Holy Sacrament or preaching
           of the word of God by lawful ministry, ordained by the
          episcopal ordination of our church, but was compelled
          to hear none but those of the presbyterian or other dissenting
          parties which was no small grief to me while I was at Oswaldkirk. Until by providence, after I came to Newton, I got the
          happy assistance of Dr Samways
             and my cousin Browne to
           
          come and consecrate (as it were) my house.
         

          
          
            The good doctor pleasing to give us the prayers of our church
            in the great parlour, with an excellent sermon and closed all with
            giving us the Holy Sacrament. Being present: Mrs Browne, and
            my husband, and niece Danby and all my children (being two
              daughters, Alice and Katherine) with my servants.
            

         
              This was the chiefest act of joy and comfort which befell me
           since my coming into this country, being then big with child
           of my dear son, Robert Thornton.

           For when I was at Oswaldkirk, being under the
           sad oppression of a dreadful, tormenting fever;
           being infinitely afflicted in it, with a troubled mind
           for the deprivation of God's spirit and his holy word and
           

Sacrament by a lawful minister;  and wanted all those
           spiritual satisfactions in them;
         

            
         
               with the loss of my dear mother and her sweet society;
              the troubles of the family, by suits of my brother against
              my poor husband; and also Nettleton suing him for £1000,
                  
              which Mr Thornton had engaged for when he entered into the
              business of the assignment of Sir Christopher Wandesford's estate in
              Ireland (which my uncle Norton made him engage to).

        
              All these so afflicted me, when I wanted spiritual
          comfort for my soul and advice for my body and temporal
          estate also, because Mr Legard had told me that it was 
          in Mr Thornton's power to cut off the entail of the estate from
           my daughters and settle it on whom he would after my death.
          Which wrought very ill with me, still fearing my own
          death each hour, so that I was desolate of all supply or
            assistance and brought me very weak, like to have died,
           and without the benefit of any to assist me in that condition.

         

          
           Until, by the wonderful power of my good God, he did
           cause me to think of and meditate on St Matthew, 11 chapter and

two last verses: <span class="evquote">Come unto me, all yea that labour, et cetera</span>.
           What my distress was at that time, I have made a 'Book of
             Meditations' upon it, and to set forth the wonderful power
          of God in my deliverances on which I recovered my health
           and strength again and was able to come to my house at Newton.</span>
       

         
           But, to return to give an account of the occasion
          of my being disposed in marriage, so remote from my
           own country and relations, et cetera. It was thus following:

         
         
          
           Upon that barbarous and cruel wars raised by the 
              Long Parliament against that glorious King and martyr
              for his faith of the Church of England, laws of the land and
           protestant religion — King Charles I of blessed memory —
             many thousand ancient and noble families of this
                  kingdom

          was ruined and undone for their loyalty to the king
           and zeal for the Church of England; in which number was 
          my dear and eldest brother, George Wandesford, esquire,
         



         
           


           
           <span class="event" id="ev18-start">who, being then by accident upon the moor at that time,
              in his return from my uncle Sir Edward Osborne's house at
              Kiveton
           (when he came out of France for want of a 
           supply out of England, being burdened in the wars).

           being the other of his guardians, he, by this means,
              was under the misfortune that day to be on Hessom Moor
          near York</span> <span class="event" id="evn2-start">when that fatal battle was fought and his
           majesty's armies was betrayed to the Scotch and Cromwell, who

           cowardice of some and treachery of other that noble army
              was overthrown, many thousands valiant, brave, stout men killed
           and inhumanely butchered, and so overcame the loyal
              party, forcing them to fly for relief to refuge to save
           them where they could.

             My dear brother, George Wandesford, seeing the
           battle was lost and willing to save my second brother, Christopher,
           being at school at York, rid thither to fetch him out of that danger
            
          but found him in the way, riding toward the moor with other boys
           which was going — in their simplicity — to see the battle.
         

         

             

           He took him up behind him on horseback and so rid in hast
           to fly from the Scots (who pursued them) to come to Kirklington
           where my dear mother and myself was then; so, by providence,
           both my brothers escaped the fury of the pursuers, coming to the gates
           at twelve o'clock at night by a back way and not through the town
           by which they were preserved. Blessed be the Lord, our God.

         

        
           We, not knowing
           but my brother George was still in France, was 
          alarmed at their coming to the gates and thought it had been the
           Scots but, hearing his voice, received him with joy and a surprisal
          for their deliverance.</span>
        
        
    <span class="event" id="ev20-start">
         
           But the Scots swore his death if they found him, and came
          the next day and searched the house, when we were all forced to hide ourselves  from their fury and madness against us, until he was got
           — by good providence, under a disguise — to be fled into the Dales and laid
           hid at one Sander Metcalfe's house in the Dales a long time.</span>
        
         
           Thus, have I, at all times and in all emergent occasions, great 
          cause to render humble thanks to God for our deliverances in the times of
           war and peace,

        and, before I proceed further, cannot omit the great
          deliverance my dear mother and myself had from the
          apparent death we were like to have been in — on that very day
          when the battle was on Hessom Moor — when she was in
          going with her children and servants to have tabled at York
          in order to the better education of my brothers, Christopher and
          John Wandesford, at school there.  And,  not knowing anything
          of the engagement of the armies, was got as far towards
              York as a place called Ten Mile Hill from Kirklington.

        

            

            When, just as we were going on our journey, there
                came a messenger in great haste to my dear mother from
                Mr Thomas Danby of Cave, who was then engaged in the
                fight at that time,
            
              who, out of the care he had to preserve her and her
              family, had sent that man on purpose to prevent her going
              to York and told her that he feared the king would lose
          the day. And begged she would save herself and return
              back to Kirklington, which she did do immediately and
              returned back that night to Kirklington and so saved us all.</span>

           care and endeavour to provide a most wise, godly and learned
              minister to supply that great parish in the care of souls at Kirklington

           against the schismatics and Scots and presbyterians then predominant
           which, underhand in their principles, joined with the papists.

           At this time, while my dear mother lived there, we had that
          great happiness to live under his ministry, being of no small
           concern to our poor souls to have such excellent doctrine, joined

             
              with his holy and pious example (which was like another Saint
           Athanasius) to be a true light to our church and family in the midst
           of the mists of those accursed practices of all contrary dissenters.
         


         
           Which next to the holy instructions and godly precepts and sweet
           exemplary examples of my ever honoured parents, I must attribute
           much of my true bottoming, and confirming my green and younger
          years to be strengthened and established in the true faith of Christ
           to that most holy and zealous preacher of God's word,
         
           who directed my steps aright and teached me in the practices of
           the primitive times, and comforted us to endure afflictions and not to be
           wavering in that true faith which was once delivered to the saints.
         
           But, alas, his doctrine was contrary to what those proud
           people taught, who when the Scotch and parliament soldiers laid
          like caterpillars, gnawing at our heart and religion until they had
          swallowed us up while we were under their tyranny.

              The affliction which laid upon this good patron of the church did
          lie so heavy upon him that the grief bore his spirit down, and by
          degrees brought a decay upon that excellent person by a decay
           of his vitals and fallen into a consumption, but bore it up with so 
          great a patience that it was not perceived by any,
         
           though he — finding his strength to abate — had bent the subject of his
          discourse for several sermons to comfort our hearts against the
          fears of death and to prepare us with patience in the loss of our friends.
           Text: 1 Thessalonians, chapter 4, verse 13.

         
           

            <span class="evquote">But I would not have

           He had gone through all the several parts of his text, several days,
           and was intended to have concluded it the next Lord's day. But God had another part to play  and to show us by his example of holy dying as he
           had of holy living and preaching, when we — none of us, feared his death,
           had made ready to go to church and hear him preach — was speedily
          called to his house to visit him on his sick bed,
         
         
            

           which was so surprising to us not
           imaginable. But it was the will of God
           to bring him to this bed, and so in great affliction for him, who to lose at that
           time was almost death to us, but he, sweet saint, seeing us thus surprised,
           lifted up himself as well as he could and said, with great cheerfulness of

         spirit, with his hands and eyes erected up to heaven, he was ready

               
        
           for his master's call. He had done his endeavour to serve him in his
           station of ministry of his holy word and though this was, to others, a
              sudden change, it was not so to him. He had endeavoured with
              St Paul to walk uprightly and to walk before him so as to give
          no offence, <span class="evquote">to keep a conscience void of offence both towards God
          and man</span>.

         
              And that he thanked God, he had lived so that he
          was not ashamed to live nor afraid to die, with many other
           excellent sayings and prayers to God for himself, my mother
          and us all, and his parish and this kingdom that God would please
           to restore truth and peace again in this, our land.
         
         
           About the time of day when the bell was ringing to
         
           church, at that time it was sent to ring this sweet soul's

           passing peal. And thus, departed that sweet servant of God,
           out of this miserable life to receive <span class="evquote">a crown of glory</span> at the
           hand of him who shall say to his sheep: <span class="evquote">Come ye blessed of
          my Father; receive the kingdom prepared for you</span>.</span>
         

          And blessed be the Lord, our God, for the life, doctrine and piety
           of this servant of God by whose means many was taught the
          way of salvation, and amongst the rest have great cause to
           praise and bless and magnify his glorious name forever (I have)
           he departed this life. 

         <span class="quote">Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord</span>; <span class="quote">for they rest from their
           labours and their works follow them</span>. O Lord, let me be one of them.
           But now, after the death of this pious minister of God's
          word, there fell upon my dear mother and her family very
          many troubles and afflictions for all the care and concerns to
         
              provide for a godly and religious, orthodox divine to be received
           into that province to discharge that weighty place (which had
           been so much under the eye of providence never to want such)
              and was her great endeavours where to be furnished.
         


           
    
         
       
           At that time, it pleased God to point out such an one, whose
          name was Mr Michael Syddall, who had married my father's
           steward's widow, Ellen Hunton, living at Kirklington.
          He offered his service to perform that part to inter that good
           man, Mr Daggett, and preached his funeral sermon, who did do
          it with much satisfaction and could preach excellently well,
          so that my dear mother and brother, George, heard him with
           great pleasure and approbation, as all others.

           <span class="event" id="ev25-start">
           That living ever belonged to my forefathers of the 
           Wandesfords; so, belonging to that family, to present to it

           

of right descended on my dear brother, George, who was the
           eldest son of my father. But he, being under age then, had
           appointed by my honoured father's will to be his guardians,
              Sir Edward Osborne and my dear mother.
            

         
              In pursuance of their power, and right to present to the
           living, they did (with my brother's consent) judge him fit — this Mr Syddall —

to that living and gave him a legal presentation to it in form,
           according to law in those cases.</span>

           By virtue of which he endeavoured to get induction and institution,
              but he was told that there could no minister enjoy a living
           without the consent of the parliament, who then did assume all
              power and authority as well in ecclesiastical as temporal concerns
              in this poor kingdom.

         
         
           Hereby, not only robbing the king of his throne and kingdom 
          but added sacrilege to God, as they had done rebellion;
          making all manner of crimes triumphant while they sat in
           the seat of that they called parliament without a head, a king
           or governor, or house of lords, but ruled and overawed all laws,
         
           equity or justice.
         

          
       
            In this circumstances, the whole kingdom — and we, as the
            rest — truckled under this slavery. And this time did Sir Thomas
              Fairfax usurp the power of the sword against his gracious
            king and made Lord General of the northern army.
         
         
           In former times, my dear mother had been acquainted
           with himself and lady, so she made application to him, as a friend,
           concerning this business of the living by way of petition

         
         
           that, since the living was void by the death of Mr Daggett
           and the right of presentation was in the guardian and the heir,
           she begged that favour of his excellency to grant that request to her,
          that the minister they had chosen might be permitted to enjoy
          the same accordingly.
         
          But, instead of granting her petition, gave her a flat 
          denial,
               
             saying that the parliament did not think fit to trust that power
          of disposal of livings in any but themselves, and so he took the freedom
          to send one to it himself which was a most inhumane part.
         

         
    
         
            
           
           But when that man he sent came to the church to prate — for
             preach he could not, being nothing of a scholar — the poor people in
           the church was so grieved, they came all out of it and left him,
           nor did they ever go again to him; who, they said, spoke and railed
           against the Lord's Prayer in York Minster, saying that they
          were all damned that used it for it was a popish invention.

           When he had uttered those railings against the Lord's Prayer
           and blasphemous speeches against this most holy prayer, which
           was spoken and taught by our dear saviour himself when he
           was on the earth, there was a poor old woman in the church
           at that time, when she heard him,
           rose off her seat in the alley and shook it (in her hand) ready
           to throw it at him cried out, 'They were no more damned
           than himself; old hackleback', and made him come down with
           shame.
         
         
         
    
         
         But after this man was, in a manner, hissed out of
           the church at Kirklington for his blasphemous speeches, he was
          forced to turn out</span> <span class="event" id="ev28-start">and would have had Mr Syddall to have
          undertook the preaching and the cure, when he should have half the
               benefit to himself and Mr Syddall the other half.

           But Mr Syddall did abhor all such sacrilegious practices.
         

         

     

           When he saw no good to be got, as to the confirmation
              of his presentation, called to mind of a friend he had been
              very intimate and kind from being school fellows, whose uncle
           was a great stickler in the committee and parliament house (whose
              name was Alderman Hoyle) and of so daring and confident
           an humour for this rebellion that he had too great a share in
           the king's blood, as appeared to his ruin afterward.
         
         
           But at this time, which was but at the beginning of their
          reign, this Hoyle sat with them and had a great vote being a man
          through laid in their practices and a deep presbyterian. Had one 
           Nesbit, which was of that stamp too, which man was the man that Mr
          Syddall made use of upon the account of confidence in his
          friendship, who made him believe he would be faithful to
           him and, upon his application and desire that request, he would
           solicit his uncle Hoyle to gain the parliament's consent that
          he might enjoy this living according to his presentation.
          He did fully promise to do this act of kindness and was well
           assured that he could prevail with his uncle — who, he said, could
          have anything granted that he desired of them — was confident
          that he could get this done for Mr Syddall, upon which hopes
           he rested a long time. And at last, he put Nesbit more fully
          for a positive answer: was told that he had done his endeavour
          to his uncle for Mr Syddall to get him that request granted
          as to obtain it for him (the living) to enjoy it as it was given
           by my brother and my mother, et cetera.

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.37&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 37</a>






         
     
           But, truly, his uncle told him it would not be granted
          that Mr Syddall might have it because they would not let
          any have the power to bestow livings which was suspected to
         
           be delinquents, but would present to them, themselves; so that it
          was in vain for Mr Syddall to trouble himself any more
           about it and (if he would take his counsel) not to do it,
         

         
           which unexpected return of Mr Nesbit was very much
           trouble to Mr Syddall. And he told him that his patron was at

           underage and had never done anything contrary to the parliament,
           nor my lady neither and wondered why they should be suspected.

         
     
           He answered, he knew not but the parliament was resolved
          not to do it and had thoughts to bestow it otherwise.
           Thus, went off all the sincere friendship (of a pretended one but
         
               none in heart) for, being half Scot by birth and a strict presbyterian
              by profession, Mr Syddall was not aware of this double deceit
              in him, both as to nation and opinion.

         
           So that it is a true belief, they both have a false quarter in them
            and this Nesbit made it fully appear, both before God and man,
           who — while he made Mr Syddall (good man) believe he was speaking
         
           for him — all that while was acting for himself and to get this living
              for himself.
         

         
     

           He, having under the notion of friendship, got some footsteps
          in his discourse how to bend his way, took advice
           of his friends and,
          perceiving that Mr Syddall and we all were of the Church of England
           which he mortally hated, knew by that clew how to wind up his
           information and upon that bottom
            proceeded against us all.
         

         
           Which was a piece of the greatest treachery, being acted against
          a poor family, that cannot be paralleled
           but by his own nation:
           who, first betrayed his sacred majesty, King Charles I, and then
           sold him and imbrued their hand in his innocent blood.</span>
         

        
    <span class="event" id="ev29-start">
          But his uncle Hoyle and himself had time enough to repent
          of this guilt of the king's blood, though God did not give him the grace. For
           after that horrid murder, he, being one of the deepest in his actings and
           consent, yet — when his conscience flew in his face for his wickedness —
          was never quiet, night or day, but still cried out he saw the king 
          follow him without a head, and said he had no hand in his blood. But
           sometimes looked back, said, 'I am damned 
           for the blood of the king' and,
           as we were truly informed, died in this manner as if distracted, but could
          never find ease, nor repentance or comfort though all the godly clergy
           was about him. God deliver us from blood guiltiness, and this above all.

              And, as we were credibly informed, did afterwards hang
              himself out of consciousness of his crime he was guilty of,
              against that innocent martyr whose blood yet cries
              against this guilty nation's.

            </span>
        

       
    <span class="event" id="ev30-start">
            
        

              As to the making way for Nesbit to get the possession of
          the parsonage of Kirklington, it was found the most plausible
              to be done by proving my dear brother, George Wandesford, to
              be a delinquent to the parliament. By which means, he not
          only forfeited his right to present to that living but also thereby
              forfeited all his whole estate, which struck all the family, roots and

              branch, which profitable prospect — to enjoy this poor gentleman's estate —
          was an undeniable argument to prevail for the gift of this 
       living to Nesbit by the parliament, who gained so well by his information . And such was his art he used that he prevailed for a
           

              sequestration to issue forth upon my brother George, my brother
                Christopher, and my mother and brother John (then a child) and myself.
      
         
      
      
        Which showed the height of malice and covetousness to grind
          the face of the poor, which at this time was fallen upon us, being
        but lately fled from the horrid Irish rebellion, wherein we were

               designed to have been murdered and escaped that misery, we fell
        under this second persecution by the factions in England (which
          may be accounted from the root of that said popery, which designed
        a catastrophe upon England, also to the true Christian faith).

         
      
           But alas, what had my dear mother, myself or my
           two younger brothers done to offend the parliament — which was not
           in a capacity to offend them, being but a weak widow and three small
           children — only to make us a prey to their vengeance because
           of our opinion and true faith against their heathenism.
         </span>

        

           But, blessed be (to) God, it was not in their power to destroy us; though
           they followed us with all their storms, yet, in God, we found mercy
           for our deliverance. Oh, that I may never forget the goodness of our
          God to us for all our preservations, in the time of this English, as
           Irish, rebellions.
     
    <span class="event" id="ev32-start">

         
           The method they used in this tragedy was to
           call up two of my cousin Norton's troopers to York, which was on the moor
          at that fight, upon promise to give them a great reward if they
           did give information of my poor brother George's being there then.

         

       

           Which these poor men, by a mistake, did confess they see him on
         

          the moor at the time of the fight, but they did not see him fight.
           They would have had them, by cross-examination, to have confessed
           they saw him fight and forced them to have sworn to it
          but the poor men, perceiving they aimed to make them swear
           to a false thing, told the committees that they never would take

           a false oath against any man, for any gain in the
           world, to take any man's life or estate from him; for though he
          was on the moor, they did not see him fight but only saw him on
          the moor that day. Upon which saying, the poor men was reproached
          by the committee because they would not swear they saw him fight
           (which would have been clearer evidence against my dear brother).
         
           But no charges paid them as was promised, nor reward, because
           they would not perjure themselves but dismissed in displeasure,

         

           

            which, when John Plummer and his fellow saw the plot against
              them, was in great rage against the committee, and wished they had
           never come to them and repented them of their folly. And one thing
              was very remarkable: </span><span class="event" id="ev33-start">these poor men was the first that ever 
              found the body of my dear brother
                  in the River

              was drowned in going to Richmond to write to uncle Darley
           to return him thanks for clearing his sequestration.
            </span>
            

         
           But the occasion of his being on the moor that day was as

           follows: <span class="event" id="ev34-start">my dear brother, George, being sent into France by his guardians 
          for education (as most of the English gentry was) for better accomplishment
           — under the care and conduct of a most pious, learned scholar's tuition
           after my father's death, whose name was Mr George Anderson —

            
              

               stayed there and improved himself in all learning and qualities
              was suitable to his birth and family. At length was compelled to return into England in the heat of the wars and could stay no
              longer in France (nor Mr Anderson, his tutor) for the want of 
              his maintenance, which could not be got out of the estate in England

         being destroyed by the parliament's wars against the king.</span>

           But was forced to return home to Sir Edward Osborne's, my uncle,
           for relief and (in his coming from thence to Kirklington to my dear
         mother, in order to his relief) was very unfortunately in his journey
           

              cast upon Hessom Moor in his way to my mother, being ignorant
              of any battle or engagement that day.
            
            
              For, if he had not been a stranger to that action or those dangers
              which followed, no man in his wits would have purposely so exposed
              himself into blood when he might have escaped.

           prove him an enemy to the parliament (being actually in

          
           arms on that moor) to which they got the testimony of the poor
              men against him as really as if he had taken up arms and had
           fought (which he did not, neither did the witnesses accuse him of it).
            


         
          But the very being there was sufficient for their ends </span>
           <span class="event" id="ev36a-start">and on which Nesbit gained his desire, and by a <span class="evquote">false witness</span>

           to that noble living of Kirklington of £300  per annum and cast Mr
              Syddall quite out by a speedy sequestration of him also.

           our poor and loyal family. For this one man's covetousness and treachery,
          <span class="event" id="ev37-start">
           we were all ruined and broken to pieces, and my dear brother
           compelled to fly into the Dales for shelter against their prosecution;

    But my uncle, William Wandesford, desiring to seek
          what remedy he could to remove or clear the sequestration and
           relieve this family then under this oppression and apparent ruin,

            

           applied himself to my uncle, Richard Darley, one and the most
              witty of the then ruling committee at York, a leading man of
           the rest; who, having formerly married a kinswoman of my
             father's, Sir William Hildyard's daughter, he pretended a kindness
              for the family and that he would do what service he could for it.

           And, having an eye of some prospect of advantage to
           his own relation, inquired what children my father (the lord
           deputy) left, was told by my uncle of my three brothers and myself. And, finding I was likely to have a considerable fortune
          and other desirable perquisites

             in a good match,
         
         
           

           immediately pressed forward in the matter, and said to
              my uncle that he had a nephew, which was a good man and a
           good estate (about £700)  per annum, which he judged might
           make a good match for me and, if my uncle would be a
           means to obtain me for his nephew in marriage, he would

          assure him of the clearing my brother's sequestration. I suppose
          my uncle was not backward to promise his utmost assistance
          and it should not be his fault if he did not prevail.

          Thus, the bargain was struck betwixt them before my

          followed most earnestly to propose this match with all imaginable 
           endeavours he could to us, and threatened, if denied, that we should
          certainly be ruined and the sequestration would proceed for Mr

           give me. Besides, at that time, a clear match or two proposed (as Colonel
              Anstruther

                  and my Lord Darcy's son, Colonel Darcy) of £1500
            per annum and more.
            
           
             She doubted I should enter upon an encumbered estate and reduced

         to very great trouble; wished me to consider what I would do, desiring
             God to direct me. But, considering the ill consequences might follow a
           denial, if I could consent in my own judgement, was willing (but 
             not to impose) to satisfy them. Oh, what a strait was we brought to in
          this great affair!</span>
         

         
    <span class="event" id="ev40-start">
          Again, I considered that Mr Thornton's relations was opposite to
           my opinion of the Church of England and religion and if he, himself, had
          been of the same rigid
               
             opinion of the presbyterians, I could by no means
           have granted to dispose so of myself (to be miserable in the great concern of
         
           my soul and to <span class="evquote">bring forth children</span> so to be educated).
            

            
     

              In this point I was resolved to put to the trial by declaring to Mr Thornton
              that I supposed he was not ignorant of my judgement and religion, wherein I was educated in the faith of God and the profession of the true protestant
              Church of England: in it, I have lived and did by God's grace intend to die,
              so that — if he was not of the same faith with me — we should be miserable and
          I would not for all the world match myself to so great misfortune.

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.42&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 42</a>






            

         Nor could he have any satisfaction to have one of a contrary
           opinion to himself. Therefore, desired him to forbear any further
          suit in that way, not being comfortable to either; for he might match
          with such which was more suitable in all regards than myself, and I was
               so happy in my condition of a single life that I loved it above all,


            
           
           having the excellent company and example of my honoured mother.

           
           
         
             
             After this discourse, most seriously and candidly delivered to
              him, I perceived his great trouble in mind. And told me that he
              was well satisfied with my opinion, and religion and all things

            else concerned me — being much above his
             hopes, desert or expectation —
             and
             also did assure me faithfully that he, himself, was of the same
             opinion and was for a moderated episcopacy and kingly government,
            
          owning that the best. And that I should enjoy my own conscience as 
             I desired, if I honoured him to marry with him and to bring up my children in
          the same faith, he did profess to me, both now and at all times.
          Having this assurance from himself, whereby the main
          point of my religion was secured to me and my posterity, if I had any,
          I was the less concerned for riches or the splendour of the world, and hoped
           in God I might enjoy that one thing necessary (as Mary did) which
          might never be taken from me if I chose here.
         
       

           He, having the character all his life of a very honest, sober
           and conscientious man, and much beloved and esteemed in his country
           (although the estate was not so dear or great as others) yet I hoped

               to live with comfort in the chiefest matters of a married estate, with
          comfort in the obedience I owed to my dear mother's choice.
           And which was more encouragement to me, that I might be serviceable
           to my honoured
             father's family in being instrumental to preserve
            
          or deliver it from that inevitable ruin fallen upon it.
           And, by this means of my acceptance of this match, I might be a
           blessing to that noble family of my honoured father from whence I
           am descended and prevent the <span class="evquote">greedy lion</span> which watched for his
           prey to have devoured us up, <span class="evquote">root and branch</span>.
         

         
           
           
           I cannot deny my great unwillingness (contrary to my
            
           resolves to continue my single condition) to consent to that
           change,</span> which involved me into a thousand miseries which I could
              not foresee or imagine that fell upon me, which made my life
           very uneasy in most of the periods. For, instead of deputing
          much of my fortune to pious uses and bestowed on Christian
           charity on many urgent necessities, as I designed when single,


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.43&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 43</a>






           

           I was plunged into great troubles and burdens upon the estate
              charged with a jointure on the half of that and five younger children
              to provide portions and maintenance for them, together with a
           house to build before we could live at his estate. <span class="event" id="ev41-start">Though, all the

          time of my dear mother's life, we wanted not her noble succour
           and be with her at all table and expenses whatever as to housekeeping
           (which was eight years and valued in that time to cost her £1600).
         

         
       
           But still I was happy in my dear mother's house and
            family in all time of danger, troubles of sickness, childbearing
            or trials whatever, never wanting the comfortable hearing the
           word of God and receiving the Holy Sacrament,</span> <span class="event" id="ev42-start">which I was forced
           to want after I came to this country (there being none that gave it
            for two years after I came to Oswaldkirk) or did I hear the


       

           comfort of our service of the church or common prayer until my
             house was builded in the year 1660. When, by providence, I had
           the good Dr Samways to give us the Sacrament and with my cousin
              Browne assisting him at Newton, first consecrating it to God.
          </span>
         
        
           
          
          <span class="event" id="ev43-start">
          The building of this house at Newton (I have heard Mr
            Thornton declare) cost us above £1500  which went out of my
          portion.</span> The charges of his younger brothers and sisters was valued
          to £1500
          more in portions, besides maintenance, et cetera, and his mother's jointure.
                  
         

         
         
        
         
           And, at this time, a suit was begun with my brother Wandesford
           by my uncle, William Wandesford, concerning the Irish estate, <span class="event" id="evn4-start">which my uncle, Richard Darley,
          had persuaded Mr Thornton to accept of the assignment of it from my
            uncle Norton — which was contrary to my knowledge or my dear mother's

            

       
       

consent — which suit cost Mr Thornton abundance of money and was
           a great motive to much of our miseries afterwards</span> <span class="event" id="ev44-start">until an agreement
              was made by Baron Thorpe. And Mr Thornton delivered up the Irish estate
           upon terms of agreement, and to pay Mr Thornton my £1000  in Ireland and
           the debt of Mr Nettleton which he was sued for by him of £1000.
            </span>
         

         
    <span class="event" id="ev45-start">
         
           But, before this agreement was finished, being done in the
              year 1664, I was reduced into very great afflictions and distress of
              body and mind, having lost my chiefest joy and comfort in my

              blessed mother, and thereon removed from my own country and
              friends and relations, the preaching of God's word and the Holy Sacrament
          according to the Church of England. The being deprived of which spiritual
              consolation, which I bless God I never knew the want of before,
          did so work upon my spirit and, together with my grief for all
           the sorrows, came on me at Oswaldkirk (after I came from St Nicholas
           where I laid in of my second son, William, who died at St Nicholas of
           the smallpox).

           After the Lord took this great and excellent blessing from me
              of my dear mother's life and removal from my own country,
              friends and relations, the being deprived of the preaching, prayers
           and communions of our church in the episcopal way of bishops, the Lord's
             Prayer and all else of sacred benefits to my poor soul, wherein I
           had been educated in the Church of England.

           

         
           We coming to live at Oswaldkirk before our house at Newton
           was builded, these things having been mentioned above (in the loss
          of my friends, relations, assistants in my distress) was very great,

            
            but much more pressures on my spirit (from the comforts of my
           spiritual concern). It pleased God to lay another affliction on me,
              added to the rest; was a great and dreadful sickness, being visited
           with a burning fever, then also big with child of my son,
             Robert Thornton. (The occasion thereof I have spoken and related
           in full in my 'First Book of My Life', with meditations thereon.)
         
         
           

           Being under a spiritual desertion, by the instigation of
           

              our grand enemy, the devil, which endeavoured to work upon my
              weakness, sickness, troubles and afflictions to make me
                   believe
                   that God had
              forsaken me and with his terrors (as on Job) to make me despair,
              because I wanted relief in my distress both from soul or body.
           </span>
         

         
    <span class="event" id="ev50-start">
         
           Which was aggravated in my sorrows by the consideration
           of the unsettled condition of my husband's estate, contrary to my
          dear mother's articles of marriage with Mr Thornton upon which
          the marriage proceeded. Videlicet: that in regard of so great a fortune
          I brought to this estate, which redeemed it from sale and other benefits,
         
            
           it was covenanted that (by Mr Thornton, his own draft of them)
          the whole estate should be so settled on my issue, male or female,
           that he could not have cut off the entail from them but, after our
           decease, my children by him was to enjoy the same which God did give
            
           me. But, contrary to this settlement before marriage, the lawyer

                  
              (which Mr Thornton chose, which was Sir
                   Robert Barwick) had so drawn
              the writings which left it in Mr Thornton's power to cut the entail off
              from my children when he would, so that there was no estate
              or portion I brought was firmly stated on any of my issue.
         

         
              Nor had I any of my children left alive then save my
           two young daughters, Alice and Katherine, though I had borne him six children
            (four daughters and two sons, having lost my two sons and two daughters
           at Hipswell, and St Nicholas, my last son, William).

           In my great sickness, looking for nothing but death and how to
          prepare for it, I was somewhat more concerned; as it did behove
          me, in going out of the world, how the estate was made firm to
           my two poor children in case of my mortality.
             </span>
         
         
         

         
           
           And I was the more concerned because — <span class="event" id="ev51-start">when I was at St Nicholas
           after my dear mother's death, was then big with child — it happened that
           at that time the happy restoration of King Charles II and of his
           coming into England and restored the church and state to its rights
           again. There was a great and general rejoicing at that good
           change in the kingdom from tyranny, oppression and anarchy.
          My being with child then, my dear aunt Norton told
           Mr Thornton and myself that, if I had a son, he would bring his
          name with him into the world and should be called Charles. But my husband answered again that it should not; after which, being in private
          with him, I desired to know what was the reason he would not have
           him called Charles, if I had a son. He presently answered, if I would
          have him so called, he should never heir a foot of his estate.</span>
         
         
               
           Which return made to my question was very surprising
            
           to me and put me upon thoughts in what condition my children
              would be in, if I left them and had died of that child? But <span class="event" id="ev52-start">my sweet child
              was born there and I reduced to great weakness in bearing him. And Mr
                Thornton had his choice of that name (called him William) </span><span class="event" id="ev52a-start">but it did not
           please God to let him live with us but died at 19 days old of the smallpox.
         </span>
         
          So, God disappointed us of that comfort and I hope he inherits in his
           heavenly Father's kingdom and so forever is provided for.
         
    <span class="event" id="ev53-start">
          This was a sufficient motive of trouble to me (joined with the rest
          and to that of my sickness) that I was like to go out of this world
           and leave my two poor innocent daughters without any settlement
          or provision firm, though all my dear mother's care and charges to have it
          done. But how unjust was these lawyers to deceive those which depended
          on their fidelity?  Only in my God to whom I prayed for direction and help.
         
            

           In my distress, therefore,  I made application to my cousin, Mr Legard,
              who understood the law, to read the deeds of settlement who did assure
              me that Mr Thornton had that power left him to cut off the entail
              of the estate and settle it upon any woman and her children, and to disinherit mine after my death. Upon which, I desired his favour to speak
              to Mr Thornton to do something to ascertain a portion equivalent

           until it pleased God a firm estate could be made for my two daughters.
          And upon this, it pleased God to move my husband's heart to consent.

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.46&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 46</a>






            

         
            
           He did draw up a bond for Mr Thornton to sign of £3000 to secure each of them the sum of £1500 for their portions, which my husband did do for the
           present in case of my death then. And so, by this he had
              the whole estate to dispose of from them if I had died.
         
         
           These terms I could not help, as my condition
           was then more like to die than otherwise, but he did promise that
           if I lived Mr Thornton would settle his estate according to the
          articles of marriage. It pleased God to restore my health again
           and in some measure (as to this) more satisfied for the present.</span>
         

         
           But, then, my greatest concern was more for the right
           education of my two poor children in the faith of the Church
          of England, which did much more concern me than that
          for their temporal provision, and this was a heavy 
          burden for me to bear on my weak spirit, that I should
           leave my two children under such a jurisdiction.

          For I found all here — in relation to this family — to be
          contrary in their judgement to my hopes or expectation,
           very much fixed either in the way and bitter profession of the
           presbytery or severe and positive papists (as all Mr Thornton's
           own relations were and his father's first wife were too).

          
               

            
            This made me destitute and out of hopes to leave the
            care of my children's souls to be right educated in the true
          faith and holy Church of England, and was a most bitter pill
          to me in this juncture of my sickness: how to have them taken
          care for in this main point and one thing necessary to their
          salvation? My soul was grieved and mourned for this sad

         effect of my marriage: to leave my posterity in such hazard (if 
          they lived) to be brought up in such a way of ignorance or of
            idolatry. Great was my sorrow and distress of mind not having
          any comforter or guide of my soul, nor any that I could advise
            withal what to do in this point which sad consideration made
          me reflect upon the ill consequence of marrying contrary to judgement.

          
    <span class="event" id="ev55-start">
         
           But while I was in deep distress which way to turn myself for relief to find redress, and Satan urging me still to despair as
          if my God had forsaken me, I was resolved to cast myself down
           at the feet of my gracious Jesus: who brought into my heart (ready to
          sink under infinite burdens then) that glorious light of his holy


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.47&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 47</a>






           gospel came into my heart, by his Holy Spirit which he spoke

            
            with his blessed mouth in St Matthew 11:28-30 verses  which
              cannot sufficiently mention: <span class="evquote">Come unto me all ye that are
           weary and heavy laden, and I will give you ease</span>, et cetera.

            
         
           Thus was the fiery darts which Satan shot against my poor
          soul to make me despair of the everlasting mercy to fall on me
           and bring me deliverance; at the moment when his strongest assaults
          was like to prevail to overthrow my faith and persuade that the day of

grace was past and my death was come, <span class="evquote">my life was so unprofitable</span>
          and God did not lay such heavy affliction upon any who was
           his servants and, therefore, no hopes either of life or salvation.
        
          But, oh, the fathomless goodness of the great and almighty 
           saviour of the world, whose business into this world was to seek
          and save all those that believed on him and to redeem lost man when
           he was not able to save himself. Now did this Almighty God put
           to flight, by the mighty power of his holy word in this scripture,
          that fiery dragon which goeth about seeking whom he may devour, night
           and day, and with this holy word gave me his spirit to assist my
           poor and weak spirit, making his mercy known to me — his faithful
           handmaid — who was almost overthrown by despair of his
          mercy through instigations of the spiritual enemy.
          And caused the light of his sacred word to shine into my
          dark and dead soul, causing me to fly unto him for succour and relief
           when Satan would have had me to run from him who, alone, could
           and would help me in and out of my sad distress.
         
         

         
           

           Oh, what shall I render to the <span class="evquote">Lord God Almighty</span>, who
              hast made and created me of nothing, and redeemed my soul and body
           by the price of his <span class="evquote">precious blood</span>, shed upon the cross, then and there
           making satisfaction to his glorious Father for our sins. <span class="evquote">He died
           for sin and sinned not</span>. This gracious and meek, this holy Jesus,
                  
              was miraculously pleased to vouchsafe to call me unto him and
              drew my sinful soul unto him by the cord of an everlasting love.
         
         
         
           Although I had sinned, yet he gave me time and grace to repent
           and to return to the everlasting <span class="evquote">Father of mercies</span>, and with the same 
          holy word by which thou overcame this lion, Satan, <span class="evquote">which thou did
           suffer to tempt thee (my Jesus)
             in the wilderness</span>, for my sake did thou
           give me power to remember, and put into thy servant's heart so
           to believe that thou didst call me and commanded me to come unto thee
           for succour and for rest. For I was one of those all to whom thou bid, 'Come'.
          <span class="evquote">Thou called me, I was weary and heavy laden with sin and sorrows
           for them</span>. Thou suffered and freed me from hell for them and thou, O Lord, didst

           call me to come unto thee for redemption from sin and misery.
           Oh, let my soul be saved and clothed with thy righteousness, holy
          Jesus. <span class="evquote">And as thou put thy enemy to flight in the wilderness
          by the word of thy eternal Father, so let the same word proceed
          against the enemy of mankind</span>. Let me draw near thee in faith 
          that thou mayest come unto me by thy grace, making me to take on me
          <span class="evquote">thy sweet yoke and learn of thee to follow thy blessed example
          of meekness, humility, lowly in heart and charity</span>.
         

               

           Lord, I come unto thee, the fountain of all good: I am one
           who labours under the burdens of sin, sorrows and afflictions.
           <span class="evquote">I am heavy laden and can get no rest</span>, and our enemy, the devil,
           seeketh to make me to add more sins by despairing of thy mercy.

        

        
          But Icast my soul down at the footstool of thy infinite
          mercy for rest, for pardon, forgiveness, relief, power to overcome all my sins and temptations. Take from me these burdens
          which I groan under, and since thou hast called me in so much
          mercy, Lord, here I come and desire of thee to give me grace to learn

         of thee <span class="evquote">to follow thy holy example; for thou art meek, patient and
          lowly in heart</span>. Oh, take from me all pride, anger, hatred of those that
          do wrong me, and do thou pardon and forgive their sins and make me to
          forgive them for thy sake, who hath suffered for me.
         
           <span class="evquote">Make me to take thy yoke upon me and to learn in what
           condition I am to be content</span>. <span class="evquote">For it is thou, Lord, that has done it</span>.
           Oh, forsake me not in my distress nor suffer me ever to forsake
           thee, my dearest saviour; for though thou kill me with afflictions, yet
           will I never forsake thee but be willing to bear thy burden, thy
          yoke, which is life and light. <span class="evquote">For thy yoke is easy to be borne and
           thy burden is light</span>; for thou, Lord, hast made it so by taking
          away the heavy load of sin and the temptation of Satan.
         
         
           And, by that power of thy mighty hand, has wrought thy great
           deliverance for thy poor, destitute, afflicted handmaid and has given
           me at this time such great deliverance. I will, therefore, sing praise
          to thy glorious name for this and all thy gracious mercies to me
          and mine, making me to endure this temptation and to overcome thy enemy, who would have taken occasion by my sickness,
          my sins and frailties, my sorrows and sufferings for them to cause me to
           blaspheme. But thou, who art mighty to deliver, hast seen my affliction
           and heard my complaint, has accepted my repentance and now, at
           last, hast brought me deliverance.
          Therefore, will I glorify thy holy name, holy Jesus, forever
           and ever. Amen.

           After it pleased my gracious God to put these good things
          into my heart, upon the prayers and meditations upon this divine word of my heavenly Father, by which I had the comfort of
           his Holy Spirit to set home this scriptures to my thoughts —
          relieving from despair and making me know that he was pleased
          to come into my soul in this miraculous and gracious manner

          sins and to give me grace to come unto my heavenly Father
          for pardon and healing my sick and wounded heart; showing me that

              the mighty power of his Holy Spirit at this time, he most graciously set home in my distress and made it appear he was a God,

          he said God had forsaken me. <span class="evquote">For God forsakes none who doth

           </span><span class="event" id="ev60-start">This being my seventh child,
           who I bore at Newton. After all my distress and sorrow, it pleased
          God to give me strength to bring him forth and this was
          my son whom I had begged of God and had dedicated
          him to his service, even my dear son of my vows, my
            son, Robert Thornton (September 19th,

           But as to the right settlement of Mr Thornton's estate
            as I mentioned before, it was not at all secured to my two

          it ought to have been on my issue — but left in Mr Thornton's power
          and not done effectually to me, as Mr Legard found.
          So that, in compassion to me and my then issue, he did
          prevail with my husband for the present, in my danger of
           death, to enter into £3000
             bond to feoffees
             in trust for my
         
           two only daughters living, Alice and Katherine, to secure
          the same to them until he could settle the estate on them

           according to the marriage articles (and according to Mr Thornton's 
           promise he would do, after his coming to Newton, that he would
          settle the whole estate of East Newton and Leysthorpe upon my issue
          by entail of male or female).</span><span class="event" id="ev62-start">
          After our coming to our house at Newton to live — and I was
          by the wonderful mercies of God so well recruited that I was able
          to come on foot thither — it was thought upon to make some
           paper books, which was drawn at London by my cousin Legard,
           
          in order to an entail on my issue general, male or female.
         
         

           But not according to a firm entail upon them, as it was
          designed by the articles of my marriage, but still the power was
          reserved in Mr Thornton to place Leysthorpe on his heirs male by
           a second wife and provide for her children, and so, thereby, to disinherit my children of their birth right and inheritance which
          Almighty God had given them.
                  
                 
       Upon the perusal 
      of which paper books, I found they were not drawn according
      to promise, nor the articles of my marriage. I found myself much disappointed by the conditions: to be willing to
           defraud my poor children of their right which I, then alive.
      Besides none but God knew whether that child I was then big with
      might be a son or a daughter, and then there would be more females to provide for (having been forced by the taking the assignment

            

           of Mr Norton to sell his land at Burn Park, which was the provision
           for his younger children, to pay off Nettleton his debt, which should
          have been paid out of my father's Irish estate but now was cast on
           Mr Thornton and all his younger children unprovided for).

         
            

         I could not yield that these books should be engrossed as
      they were, whereby I and my posterity should be cut off their
           right of inheritance, being contrary to that standing ordinance
      made by Almighty God himself in the case of Zelopehad's

        
           daughters which he expressly charged to Moses in 
           Numbers 27, verse 1.

     

         
         
           Nor had I, here, any kinsman, brother or friend of my
              own to stand for my interest or my children's, to consult withal
              in the case to have advice how to have the writings drawn firm
           to them, according to law, in a case so much concerned myself and
              posterity since Mr Legard had proved so biased against us.</span>
         

         
    
          Besides this failure — in the right and just settlement to be made
          in my husband's estate and land to be done for my poor children
          of my body — <span class="event" id="ev63-start">there was another wrong done me by the drawing up
          of a deed of settlement and disposal of all my dear mother's personal
          estate, which she


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.52&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 52</a>






            
           


        by her last will and testament had given to me to dispose
           of it as I should think fit (by will or deeds) to such child
          or children as was best deserving. And put the property of her
          said goods and personal estate into feoffees in trust for my life
           and to have power to dispose of it at my death.
         
            

           To which purpose, I, not hoping to live long in this life
              so full of sorrows and trouble, sickness and crosses — being to pass through
              that dreadful dangers of childbirth, coming out of them
              with dangers and difficulties — desired Mr Henry Best, who had
            married my sister's daughter, Katherine Danby,

            
         
           that he would please to draw up a deed of gift, with a
              schedules
                   annexed which part each of my children should have
              according to my dear mother's will and deed, and to the power she had
              given me: that they should not be made liable to the debts
              or engagements which my dear husband had been so
           unfortunately drawn into by the assignment.
          For she pleased to say the reason why she disposed them,
           thus: that why should my bed be taken from under me by those
          debts which he ought not to pay?
         
            
           But this nephew Best forfeited his trust, and drew
          those deeds after such a manner as did flatly ruin my

         

           dear mother's care of me and mine. And made the
              deed absolutely to give my mother's goods and moneys all into
              the power of the creditors, which was a very grand wrong to
           me and mine. But, upon the reading the deed after the engrossing, I found the fallacy to be contrary to the feoffee  
              draft and I would not sign it.
          </span>
         

          
            Thus, by the mercies of my gracious God, I was delivered

            at this time also (and my children also). Therefore, will I praise
            the Lord, my God, forever for his preventing goods to me and
          mine, and did preserve us from these dangers in our estate.

         
    
         
            

           
           <span class="event" id="ev64-start">Finding my time of delivery was drawing near — and
          not having any to put my confidence in as a faithful friend
            
           to draw the deeds and settlement of the estate right, that I might
        not have my posterity injured when I might be disposed of by
           death — I cast myself down before the <span class="evquote">throne of grace</span>,
        humbly begging of God his assistance to direct me to some
        good, faithful friend and able lawyer, which would draw up
        such writings and settlement in this poor estate which might
           (might) make a firm settlement and provision for my children,
   

   
        as well for the just inheritance as provision for younger
        children's portions and maintenance out of Mr Thornton's

          was left as a provision for his heir, as Newton for my jointure
          and the land of Burn Park was settled for the provision of his
     younger children.
     </span>
   

         
            

           
           <span class="event" id="ev65-start">
           After I had poured out my complaint to God and made my
            petition to him, it came into my thoughts that my cousin,
              Roger Covill, was a very able lawyer and a good honest man
           (a friend to our family and had done many offices of kindness for

          us) and that I hoped my husband would accept of him to give
          his advice and assistance in the case.
         
          To him I applied myself in this case and confided in him to
          being an able and good counsels, and I hoped would draw up a
          good and substantial deed of entail of the whole estate to be
           settled: Newton for my jointure, during life and after our decease,
           upon my issue, male or female,

           according to the articles of marriage.
         
          
           Leysthorpe was also so settled and entailed on my issue in like
           manner, with such provisions: first, out of it made firm to my
             two daughters for provision for maintenance and portions for them,
           before Mr Thornton (in case of my death) or his heir male after him



               

           could enjoy that estate, and the sum of £1600  to be paid to
           them. This deed of my cousin Covill's (Dated: June 3rd — 1662).

         

         
              This settlements, and all of these concerns of the right fixing
              the estate upon my poor children, has cost me very many sorrows and many sums of money for charges, upon this concern
           to get this poor estate fixed for my issue — besides much grief that
           befell me on such occasions of alterations, and cutting off entails —
            

            
              being loath to go out of this world and leave my children

              miserable. And Mr Thornton was pleased to make this so
              stated and in this deed in this manner; in consideration, as he said,
          that he had a great fortune with me and that the land at Burn Park
              was sold to pay debts (which was settled for my younger children's
          before my marriage) and to perform his promise

            before Baron Thorpe.
         
         
         
    
         And, also, at that time — on condition that Leysthorpe should be
           set apart for that purpose — I was willing to grant to part with my £1000
            
           (£1000

               
           part of my portion in Ireland) to pay Mr Thornton's debts,
           which was secured by him by bond to trustees, for my use before marriage,


            

           as an addition of my jointure for my life (because all the rest of my
              fortune was for him to dispose and that the estate at Newton was very inconsiderable, as my mother and friends thought).
          

      
            And this I yielded, out of my love to him
        
              
            and
         his children, to pay
        his remaining debts. And whereas, by my own mother's jointure
        and Mr Thornton's, they had the liberty of the wood mentioned with 
        the clause of 'without the impeachment of any manner of waste',

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.54&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 54</a>






            

         in regard of the consideration of my valuable fortune, it
           was — by Mr Thornton's consent and of his own act of kindness —
          he did make it so in my jointure at East Newton also.
         
            
           But, at this time, I was willing for the good of the family

         and my children to have this liberty (which I might have had)
              and power left in me to cut down all the wood to either help
           myself or et cetera. To be only expressed that I had power for firebote,
           housebote, hedgebote and for myself to make use of, for repair
              and necessary uses. But how far this hath obliged some of the
              family to regard me accordingly — when I had nothing left me
              to maintain my son, if I should have one — I knew not. But

            have had sufficient cause to repent my kindness, being left
          <span class="evquote">a desolate widow</span> and not any allowance to educate my poor
            son, who God did after bestow on me, September 19th,
             1662.
         
         
           (Besides an infinite debts left for to be paid after Mr Thornton's
           death, and little and nothing to pay withal.)
         
           I yielded all these privileges, and my £1000 portion and
          to take upon me the education of my son out of my single
           jointure, on conditions my two daughters should be secured
           their portions of £1600
             and Mr Thornton's debts remaining
            to be paid.
         
          All which I took to be acts of signal love, affection and kindness
           to my husband and children, hoping to God those good ends
           would follow for which I did them. But there was a contrary
        use made of all these condescensions.
          For — having done all these things above mentioned, to my
        great detriment and loss in my estate, to satisfy Mr Thornton and to pay
        all his debts (though I knew not what they were or to whom) —
        I had hopes to believe that the estate of Leysthorpe might have been
           kept entire in that capacity, according to the true intent of Covill's
           deed (done with Mr Thornton's full consent and not urged but voluntary done,
        and with great equity towards his children and debts).</span>
         

         
         
               
         
         <span class="event" id="ev66-start">
         But how this deed was evaded or when, I knew not, or on
        what occasion. Only I remember Harry Best asked me if I would

         
              not grant that his uncle should have one or two of the closes in Leysthorpe
         to be made liable to secure a little debt he owed to Sir Henry Cholmley.

         

            
         I told him again, I knew not of any debt to Sir Henry Cholmley
                  
              and, if he did owe him anything, I hope I had done enough to
              clear that and all his debts by giving up all Burn Park to be sold
              and my £1000, which was above £3000,
              besides my £1500 
              portion out of Kirklington. I was much concerned he owed more.
            

         
           After this discourse, I told him I could not grant to unsettle
           the estate of Leysthorpe, which I came so hardly by and cost me so much
           and was all I had left for my children and could not do it.

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.55&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 55</a>






         
           And I was assured he could not cut off the entail without my
           consent, which I never would do it. After a little time, he said
          his uncle would do it without me and it were better to consent willingly
          and oblige him. I answered that I had yielded to destroy myself
           and I hope he would not desire such a hard thing against my children.
          But I, trusting in this Mr Best, as to be a faithful friend to
           me, and that he would give me his advice, upon reading the deed,
           whether Mr Thornton had power to cut it off without my consent
           because cousin Covill charged me not to consent; for, if I did, it
           would destroy the inheritance and he could not do it without me.
         


         

               

           (But how this deed of Mr Covill's was evaded, or when it was
              done, I knew not until long after, being kept in a wholesome ignorance
           except, upon Harry Best's reading it upon my desire to be satisfied
           of him, as a friend to myself and poor children, being so near in
           relation — desired his cordial advice to me upon that point).
            


            
              He, having read that deed over, pretended that his uncle
              had power to destroy it on pretence of a flaw he found of a contingency to fall out, in case of my decease, to provide for my two daughters
              to have a portion and education fixed, being the essential part of that
              deed. Which, when he had done, said his uncle had full power to destroy it without my consent and to make another, which he would
          not for anything he should know it; charging me that I should not
          tell him of it, for if he knew his power he would certainly cut
          it off and that would be ill for my children.
          I said, I was very sorry it was so, and I was sure my cousin
          Covill did not understand he had so, for he would not have
          done it to betray me and my children. He answered that he was sure
          Mr Covill did not know of it, for it was a new thing found out
           in law he had not been acquainted with. So, I begged him as a
           friend, and had advised with him in my children's behalf, not to discover it to Mr Thornton for fear of the ill effect might follow.
          And withal, I had parted with all my portion of £1000  from
           myself and to sell the land at Burn Park to have this made
           sure for my two daughters and, if this was undone, it would ruin
           them and me too. Upon which, he faithfully promised me he would
          never acquaint Mr Thornton with his power and bid me keep that deed
          up, lest at any time he might see it.
          Yet, notwithstanding all this fair promise to me, I was
           assured by my brother Denton, long after, the deed was destroyed then,
          at the same time he had spoke thus to me,

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.56&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 56</a>






            

         Mr Best went immediately out to Mr Thornton and 
           told him of the flaw he found in that deed by which he had
           power to cut it off and make a new one. And showed him
           the way he must go to do it and advised him to do it
           without my consent. On which, Mr Thornton closed with that motion

         

            and went immediately upon that business.
         

     
        
       
       At which time, I suppose — as it appears by a little deed for
       two years made by Mr Thornton (dated September 9th, 1665) —
        to enable him to cut it off and gave possession to trustees, Mr Francis
          Darley, et cetera.
      
      
        Thus, was I (poor, innocent creature) most basely betrayed by a false friend, in betraying his trust to me
        to the utter destruction of myself and poor children, who, by
        this, had nothing in the world left them to provide for
        them, either maintenance or portions: all my land and
        own portion being already disposed for debts, et cetera.
      

      
       
        And another deed was made instead of better
        settling their maintenance and portions to them, which was to
        make provisions in the first place for a second wife and
        for her children's to take place before my first born child
        of my womb, and by that means to disinherit those which God
        had given me and spared out of nine children I had borne him.
      

      
        Also, charging the said estate of Leysthorpe with
        the payment of £800 to be paid to his

       own younger brothers and sisters in case of the failure of
        issue male, and that the inheritance should come to fall on my
        issue female, over and beside, with portions they received
        out of my husband's estate before which he had told me
        was about £1500  amongst them. So, they was very well taken
        care for on all accounts, when there was no provision
        made at all for my son and heir if I had one, as I then had:
        my son, Robert Thornton, being of three years age. A strong child.
       
            But it was prudence to secure a jointure and provision
         for a second wife while I was alive and had heirs of my body,
         which was all cast out, and all my fortune disposed of which
        might have been subsistence for them.
       
         There was also care taken by that deed to pay debts,
        all which could not have been done out of that small estate of 
        Leysthorpe which was but £120
         a year.
       </span>
         

         
    <span class="event" id="ev67-start">
         
           Since this new deed was discovered to me, which was

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.57&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 57</a>






         but a little before I was delivered of my last
       
          child, Christopher, nor had I suspected any such thing but
           that Mr Best (upon Mr Comber's going to London to take his
           masters of arts degree seeing Mr Best) asked him from me
        whether he knew his uncle had made a new settlement of
        Leysthorpe. Answered he had and that I needed not make so much
        ado about it for it was better done than before.
       
          

         Which put me to much concern what might be the consequence
         of it, fearing what my cousin Covill told. After which, I entreated

         my brother Denton to beg of Mr Thornton that I might see it.
      He told me he had it delivered to him in trust by Mr Thornton
          
        and he could not betray his trust. Upon which I declared I could
        not go out of the world without I could be satisfied that my
        children were well provided for, and should be an unnatural
         mother if I had not discharged my conscience to them.
         I, being in a great danger of death upon bearing my children,
        desired that satisfaction of my husband to see it.
       
          

         After which, being troubled that I should put them upon so
        unpleasant a business, yet stayed an hour and until my brother Denton
         brought it to me. But, upon the reading of that deed, I fell
        very ill upon the consideration of the vast difference and alteration betwixt the two deeds, nor could I be satisfied until I had
        applied myself to Mr Thornton — with humble request and bitter
     

         tears and complaint — to see those things mentioned, as before said.
       

         
       

           It pleased God, upon my humble request to the <span class="evquote">throne of
         grace</span>, that he would have mercy on me, and my children he had
          graciously given me and continued with life, that he would please to
          let me find favour from my husband and that he would grant

          me those requests to have this estate to be settled for my children.

          
         
            And to provide for my younger children's maintenance
           and portions, so as they might not be disappointed of it when I was
          gone or himself.
         

               


           After which most humble petitions to my great God and
        Father of all in distress, he was pleased to grant my request and to
           move my husband's heart to incline to me in this thing, and to tell me,
        if his brother Denton would do it, he would have it done so.
         </span>
        
        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.58&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 58</a>






            
      
    <span class="event" id="ev68-start">
         
         And after much discourse and arguments, used by myself and
           Mr Comber, to my brother Denton and acquainting Mr Thornton,
        another deed was drawn by brother Denton, wherein such provision
        was stated as Mr Thornton and he did approve of for my children's
        portions and maintenance as it did stand at my husband's
         decease. The half of that estate being set over to pay his debts,

       

        

         which I could not prevent since his circumstances was
         so ill by them, and from the great trouble and suits came on him
         by the taking on him the Irish estate to manage.

      

   
         
     But, although the £800 to his younger brothers and sisters
    was not mentioned in this latter deed for settlement for my
          children, yet a prudent care was had to make another
          deed on purpose to secure the said £800  to them in case of
     the failure of issue male (though at that time my husband had


           

a delicate son — my dear son, Robert Thornton, who was at
     that time six years old at his father's decease — and, therefore,
        it could not justly be said my husband died without issue
     male, who, it pleased God, lived to be 26 years old, et cetera).</span>
     


        
          <span class="event" id="evn5-start">
                   The true intent and design of Mr Covill's deed of Leysthorpe
            was to make provision for the two younger children, which was
            cut off by the sale of Burn Park and the land gone from that use
          so none was left but this, and to perform Mr Thornton's promise
            before Baron Thorpe to settle on them such an estate out of Leysthorpe
            before I did yield to pass a fine of Burn Park to free him from
          Mr Foxley's debt (who threatened by Mr Nettleton to execute a
          judgement of him). And, out  of my love for my husband, granted
              
          upon those terms to secure the same for my children
          out of Leysthorpe, which was never done until now by cousin Covill's deed.
        

         
           And now, having at that time none living but these two
             daughters, having borne him six at Hipswell, thought it high
           time to save something for these surviving children: and
          this deed of cousin Covill was made to provide for them two
           daughters, Alice and Katherine, I then had and being big with
           child, in case I should have a son, he would heir the land
           and they would be unprovided of portion or maintenance.
          And in case of my decease, or a second marriage or my
          son to live, then this settlement provided for them and
          they could not be defeated of a fixed provision, which was but
          just to provide for them thus when the other land at Burn
          Park and all my portion was gone.

         Nor could this deed be evaded by any legal right which was
          expressly made for those ends mentioned to be a security for them
           which he makes a contingency,</span> <span class="event" id="evn6-start">or how could Harry Best pretend
           to avoid that contingency by his advice to cut it off?

         

               

           When as the very doing it was to establish that estate to
           provide for that which Covill's deed was to prevent: videlicet, to settle it
              upon a second wife and her children's provision before mine, who was
              born and wanted provision, to have been had before a second wife and
           hers came in (considering also that Mr Thornton had received
              with me a greater fortune than would have purchased his
           estate).

            

         
           

           And I may
           say with too much grief, if — my dear mother's due
      and rights I had from her estate in Ireland, my brother John's
           (who fell to me due, on my brother George's death) together with my 
      own rights from my father's will, the sum in all amounted to
           above £12000  more — had not been unfortunately managed
      by Mr Thornton's entering into that assignment of my uncle Norton 
           by which he not only ruined himself and me and his posterity,

          but I might justly say that what was received with me —
       by my father and mother's bounty — was above what might have
           purchased Mr Thornton's estate as it was besides what was lost.

         

            

           For I can make it appear he did receive above £8000.
              
           Therefore, how unjust an act done to my poor posterity in this
          deed by cutting off my cousin Covill's when a great sum of
          £800  to be paid to the sisters and brothers, if my husband died with
          issue male and so totally destroy the heirs of my body.</span>
           
     

       
    <span class="event" id="ev69-start">
         

            I have writ more on this subject, being the great concern
           of my life, and under what burden I laid by this means when I first
      heard it was done, when the grief had well-nigh
           cost my life and by
           which I fell into a desperate extremity by a miscarriage (August 16,
             1666) which continued upon me for a long time together, and all that
      Dr Wittie could do could scarce save my life from sinking.

            

         
      

           Nor was I cured then by any human means. But by a
        miraculous power from heaven, who gave me power to believe in the
            
           Lord Jesus Christ only for help and deliverance and brought that portion
        of scripture into my ears, when I laid almost dead in extremity
        and desired the prayers of my husband and the family. Mr Comber
        saying prayers, it was the proper lesson for that day in St Matthew
        rehearsing that great miraculous cure which our dear Lord and
           saviour

          and immediately she was made whole and was

             

          healed of her infirmity</span>.
         

         
           
        Even thus it was with me, a poor creature, who laid
        languishing upon my bed and could not be able to turn myself or rise up for my soul was upon departing. Until I had
        heard this holy scripture, by which means the Lord did show
        what a mighty power he had and what mercy he showed to this
        poor woman to give her faith to believe in him that he could cure
        her, and grace to come unto him for her cure.

      
        Thus, did my gracious saviour draw me to him at this
        time and came unto me in my distress as she was. He came into my
        heart by his holy word and miracle done to his handmaid on
        earth, and though I could not see him with my bodily eyes, yet he
        gave me grace to believe in him, who was as well able to heal
        me now he was in heaven and I on earth.

         
            
        Yet he was the same God and was pleased to show mercy
      in all time of my distress when I called upon him. At this time

              

        also, I laid hold on his mercy and believed he was able to deliver
        me out of this sad and lamentable condition as he did to this woman,
        and humbly begged pardon for my sins and deliverance from
           this sad calamity: <span class="evquote">Lord, I believe: help my unbelief</span>. And as <span class="evquote">by
           thy providence</span> caused this, thy holy word, to come into my ear
           at this time; oh, let me find the effects of it in thy curing of this
        great extremity of sickness. And restore me to my life and
        health again that I may have time to <span class="evquote">work out my own
        salvation before I go hence and be no more seen</span>. And that I may

      finish that work which thou hast appointed in my generation.

       
            Then will <span class="evquote">I set forth the praise of the Lord forever</span> and will magnify thy holy name to all generations. Come, Lord Jesus, and heal
         thy weak handmaid as thou did do to this poor woman;
         for I believe thou art full of compassion to those that trust in thee, 
        and have often experienced thy merciful goodness in all my
         troubles. <span class="evquote">Bless the Lord, O my soul, praise his holy name</span>.
       
       

            
         For no sooner than I had poured out my praise and prayers
        to the holy Jesus, but he embraced me with the arms of his mercy
        and my soul found relief. And I was immediately healed
        and perfectly cured. I felt the fountain of my blood stopped and I
         never more returned to flood again.</span> <span class="quote">Oh, bless the Lord, O my soul,
         and all that is within me praise his holy name, forever and ever</span>. Amen.

           <span class="event" id="evn7-start">
           It was a very remarkable circumstance that it was not above
          three months betwixt my dear husband's making the first deed of
          giving possession and seizure of the land at Leysthorpe to Mr Francis

           Darley (dated: September 9, 1665) in order to cut off Covill's settlement</span>
          before <span class="event" id="ev70-start">he fell sick of his first palsy fits, whereof he escaped very
           narrowly then. And was most strangely preserved by Dr Wittie's cure —
           and infinite means used for three years afterwards by myself and the doctor —

     
        
       having never been clearly two months free after the palsy


       seized on him (November 16, 1665) at Stearsby, where he was then sick
          of the palsy when the main deed was signed and sealed, as I have
       heard. And the occasion of his journey then, at that unseasonable time
       of the year for cold, was to borrow £400 to lay out in a purchase of
          land to settle it for my brother Thomas Thornton's portion.
     


         
           (Which land, so bought for him, he did not return the kindness to my husband by entailing it upon (on) himself or children
          in case of his failure for want of heirs, but he settled that land
          upon my brother Denton's children and sister Portington's and, for want
          of their children, then to fall to the poor of the parish of Stonegrave,

         

            


           when all this time my dear husband's estate lies under
           the heavy pressures of this debt and interest since November 1665.)

            
         
           And this sad distemper of the palsy, which seized on my dear
             husband at that time, did at last carry him off and was the cause of
              his death: he enduring a very great many afflictions and extremities
           by fits until, at length, it prevailed against him and me by that desperate grief
              that none thought I should have lived.
            </span>
         

         
    <span class="event" id="ev71-start">
         
            And when I saw myself reduced into so low a condition by grief
           and sorrows, upon such changes in the estate and my dear husband's illness,
          it highly concerned me take care of the disposal of my eldest daughter
           to one who might take care both of herself and assist the rest of my two
             children in their education, and take care of them all when we were gone.
         

         
          


            So that we closed with the proposal of marriage made to Mr Thornton
            by Mr Comber for my daughter, Alice, if it pleased God she might live to
            be the age of marriage and making all the fair testimonies to prove a
            good man (pious, learned and understanding) with a great prospect of his
        deserved merits to be capable of preferment in the church and of a true and
        loyal education and zeal for it,

            
               

              these was great inducements to choose here, for her: to a wise, discreet
        person rather than to a great estate without those good qualifications. And these
        was the motives and ground of our choice of this match, being more enlarged
              on this subject in my 'First Book of My Widowed Condition'.</span>
      


        
          I humbly made my petitions to heaven: that he would please to
          direct and guide me in this great and weighty concern of my dear child's
      marriage; that we might dispose of her for a blessing to herself and to us
          (her parents) and to me, who had with great and exceeding sorrows and pains had
      brought her out into this world as it may be more at large seen in my

          'First Book of My Life' expressed (in her birth and deliverances more at
          large) how dear she was to me. So, the Lord would continue his most
          signal care over her and mercy towards me, her poor mother, as to
          provide such an one to be her
               
             husband and her guide that she might
          be a happy wife and live comfortably in this life, <span class="quote">and bring forth children</span>
          to the glory of God and salvation of their souls, and be a comfort to each
          other in this great change of her life. <span class="quote">For Jesus Christ, his sake</span>. Amen.

         

             

           To all these humble petitions, I bless the Lord God of mercy,
        I hope he did vouchsafe to grant. And gave her a great share of
        happiness and prosperity as a blessing to her from heaven for her
           reward of being a good and gracious child (even from her infancy,
           being both dear and tender to me and obedient to us both): full of virtue,
        piety and modesty, and many graces eminent in her youth and more
           riper years. <span class="quote">For which I render to the God of heaven all possible, 
           praise and glory forever for all these riches of his grace to me and mine</span>.
         

         
         And since I have endured so many afflictions of soul and body in
        the troublesome affairs of this life by the malicious designs of the
        devil and his instruments to hinder and frustrate all my endeavours
        for the establishment of the gospel and true faith of Jesus Christ in my
        children and family, and to cut off my poor life as he would have done to
        poor Job in moving of God to destroy him,
       
         yet, blessed be my gracious God and <span class="quote">Father of mercies</span>, he did
        not suffer him or his instruments to prevail over me, or to destroy and
         root me out of the <span class="quote">land of the living</span> or my posterity.
         

           
         
         <span class="event" id="ev72-start">
           For though he came against me by his temptation, first to despair
           of Gods mercies, then tempted me to impatience and mourning,
               and too much
          grief upon my husband's cutting off the entail and of immoderate
          fear for my children to want provision.

          

         
           After that, by grief and affliction upon that action, which by some unjust
           advice of my own friends and wrong dealing toward myself and children,

          

         

            I fell into a desperate miscarriage; from thence, into a fatal flood,
        near to have cast me into despair and death from which I hardly
           escaped.</span> Then, after these storms had blown over me, to fulfil

          
          
           the height of his implacable malice would not let me enjoy
             the great
           comfort of my life: the inward happiness I had since I was born of
           the testimony of a good conscience in a holy, chaste, good life and conversation,
        by which I received the sweet enjoyment of a <span class="quote">good name</span> never yet
        defiled with the least unchaste thought, or word or action by God's holy

             

         grace (given to me ever since I was born and preserved me in).
         

      
           
        Yet, he and his instruments sought by unjust, lies, slanders,
      false suggestions, endeavoured to throw aspersions on me and secretly to
        wound my unspotted life and conversation by which means not only to
        murder my soul but, with one dart, to kill my poor, weak body.

       

            

         Nevertheless, notwithstanding all these <span class="quote">snares and nets</span> which he
        had laid for me to catch my poor soul withal, I must behold with joy
        and admiration of the fathomless goodness, mercy and compassion of




        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.63&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 63</a>





         
          our most gracious <span class="quote">Father of heaven</span> — who did hear and
          answer my humble requests, and gave me a speedy deliverance out
         of all my troubles when they fell upon me — heard my complaints,
         granted what he, in his wisdom, saw fit for me his poor creature
          and destroyed the snares that the devil and hell had laid for me

         

            

           to have destroyed me and mine. And, thus, did he, <span class="quote">in his good
           providence, make a way for us to escape</span> and brought good out
           of evil, light out of darkness and, in the midst of all my deep
           distress, made a way for to escape both from the destruction

            of this poor estate, from settling
           it from my children and family.
         

         
           And more firmly got it, thereby, settled on them without
          any more alterations — I bless my God — during my husband's
          life time; nor did he withhold his great mercy from me
           by drawing his faithful and conjugal love and affection from me,
          for all those bloody and wicked practices of all my secret enemies to have made him have taken his endeared affection
          away from me, which would have been worse than death to me.

         

         

           Which he had so many years experiences of my faith
         and truth to him in the actual, candid and sincere practice
        of my chaste life and conversation, which I had ever followed
        with an unspotted reputation ever since I was born;
           for which I humbly bless and praise the God of mercy, who
           both made me so and gave me the grace of perseverance.

          
         
           Nor durst ever any presume to make any offers, or the least

          show of an unchaste action towards me; never being allowed
           the least tincture of unbecoming behaviour in my presence.

          But have sometimes lost the favour of persons so inclined
          by my severe behaviour or advice and counsel to servants and
          others that I perceived their inclinations to any immodest looks
          or behaviour,

         

            

           taking more comfort by doing my duty in that  chaste
          course of life then in all the vain follies or blandishments this
           whole life could afford; having been blessed by my God, in that, by the
          prevention of some notorious wickedness of servants by the watchful care and concern I had over their actions.

            
     

         And herein I found the Lord to be so gracious towards me that

               
        
        we had the happiness never to have any such misfortunes in our
          family to have any miscarriage in it; for which I humbly praise
          his holy name and beg always his preventing grace to continue it
          over me and mine, and all that do belong unto us.

      The full confidence that my dear husband had in my
      virtuous life gave him so full assurance of my fixed
      faith to him in all its branches, that all the wicked practices
           and odious surmises,

             which some of those made to turn his
            
        [heart]
    
            
          heart from me, I bless God, could never prevail in the least
           thought imaginable (and this he has often declared to
           me his self with great vehemency and zeal).
         
         

            

          
          <span class="event" id="ev73-start">
          And, in particular, he declared his abhorrency of Mrs Anne
        Danby's abuses, when she set her railing maid Barbary
        to break my heart and my dear child's by forcing the lies
           upon us, which was invented to break that match (which lies
        she knew in her conscience was a great falsehood).

          
         
       Upon which noise, when she was persecuting us with slanders,
      my dear husband did break open the door in the scarlet
       chamber, and did kick Mrs Danby down, calling her a most
       base, ungrateful woman to abuse me, his chaste and dear wife,
       but he would turn her out of his house. Had she thus requited
      me for my charity, to murder by her tongue not only my
      body by excess of grief but also, if she could, to destroy my
      chastity and my innocency by lying tongues?

     
          But he told her, he would take my part and defend
      my cause against all the world. And did hate all those that
      had such a design to ruin himself and children in the
      distraction of me, and seeking to blast my honour
       and reputation.
         
         
            

           'As for your part' said my dearest husband, 'you do

          know in your own conscience that there has been a long time
           a match intended amongst us betwixt my daughter,
             Alice, and Mr Comber. And that yourself was the first that
          made the motion in it, as it would be a very happy
           match for us and our child.

        
     
       And would you now be so ingrate and unworthy to
       your poor aunt as to hear those lies against her, and
          not to stop their mouths and let me and her know who did
          thus wrong us and I shall make them be punished?'

         
       
            

         Thus, when my dearest husband had taken my part against her  and defended my cause, finding she had heard of
 
         my slanders about a year ago and still kept it close from me,
          though she had been so much nourished, and kept and maintained
         with her husband and children above 20 years by me — out of my

         charity and affection for my sister's children in distress — yet
          would she not be so good a Christian to discover it by which I might
          have had my wronged innocency

             cleared at the first,
         

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.65&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 65</a>






         and my enemies been punished or myself righted. And when she
          was charged with treachery towards me, she still replied that she
          knew in her conscience I was innocent of those things and she also
           knew of that intended marriage and, therefore, she did not believe
           none of them. My dear aunt Norton told her: why, then, did
           she not tell me or Mr Thornton how I was wronged?

         

            

           She was the more base woman for concealing these lies from
           me, whereby my wounds was more deep and incurable that had not
           been taken notice of all that time. She deserved death for her great
        wickedness towards me, but she was confident God would revenge my cause upon her and all those which had been so wicked.
            


         
       So, my dear husband immediately turned her maid
       out of the house and threatened her severely to make her smart for what
        she had done if she ever durst presume to mention anything she

had heard.</span> <span class="event" id="ev74-start">For they was all proved lies by the servants in the house,
       who was examined strictly by Mr Thornton and my brother Denton,
     

         

               

           and upon their oath did justify my innocency from all
           those horrid lies had been told. Barbery herself did avow she
           never heard or see any thing in her life of me and believed I was wronged,
              and so said they all.

              But laid their frauds upon one Mary Breakes which was
              gone and which Daphne writ to at London to let her know my abuses
           was laid on her. But, she did write Daphne word, she vowed she
              never heard or see no such things of me in her life, and that it grieved
          her soul they should abuse me and wrong her, and that she knew I did
          hate all evil things in everyone and always gave them good instructions.</span> <span class="event" id="evn8-start">Now after these sad troubles of mine — which I suffered
           I knew not from whom nor for what but made the scorn of many
           and yet the Lord gave me favour and pity of my dear friends — I
          was wounded in my soul, and with great sorrows and violent griefs did
         
         

            

           fall into great extremity of weakness, and none thought I should
           have lived. And while they were yet in the house, I had no peace or
        ease, or sleep or comfort until my gracious
               
             God did hear my sorrows
           and sufferings and gave me comfort of my husband and children
           and friends (who mourned and wept with me and gave me what redress they
           could, begging of God for mercy to relieve me in this great extremity).</span>
         

         

            

           <span class="quote">To him, alone, I poured out my prayers and tears and cries</span> in this
           great calamity to be restored of my <span class="quote">good name</span> and to <span class="quote">judge my cause</span>

         According to the prophet, David, <span class="quote">I committed my cause and complaint</span>,

         thou my cause, O Lord, and deliver me from wicked and deceitful men</span>.
        <span class="quote">The Lord deliver
             
         me</span>, grant me grace and patience to drink this <span class="quote">bitter cup</span>
         which thou, my Jesus, hath tasted for me when those of <span class="quote">my own house doth
         rise up against me</span>. <span class="quote">Hide not thy face at my tears</span>, for I am a poor, despised

       creature who suffers for thy cause and for the defence and propagation of thy gospel in this place and family where I am thus
         persecuted and distressed. Oh, do thou, O Lord, take my part and
         defend thy cause and my innocency which thou, Lord, has given me.
          <span class="quote">Oh, let the wickedness of the wicked be destroyed</span> and guide thou, 
           thy servant, through all <span class="quote">the darkness of this world</span>. And let
           not thy handmaid be utterly destroyed, <span class="quote">for I put my whole
           trust in thee, O Lord</span>. <span class="quote">Oh, do thou make them all ashamed that
           hath risen up against me, thy servant</span>. Thou, God of justice, hear
        
        my sad complaint and <span class="quote">bring me out of all these snares that
           the devil, the tempter, has laid for me</span>.
          <span class="quote">Oh, hear my cry, O Lord</span>, and <span class="quote">hide not thy face from my
           tears but preserve my soul</span>; for I am thy servant, hoping
        in thy power to defend me from all wickedness of soul and
        body that I may live
             

           to see thy glory in the resurrection of my 
        <span class="quote">good name</span>. And my mouth and heart and soul will give glory
           to thy great and holy name for evermore. Amen.

         
           This humble prayers and sorrowful complaints to my 
          gracious God did he graciously hear and many of them
           grant which way he, in wisdom, saw fit for his own glory and
          praise forever.
        
    <span class="event" id="ev76-start">
         
          For this very maid of Mrs Danby's, which she had made
        her instrument to publish my dishonour by the lies they had
           heard, God did show a most remarkable thing upon herself and children; for she, married to one John Pape, had one child
           which fell sick of the smallpox like to have died of them, but only
           had them come forth all of one side of all the body, from head
           to foot extreme full, but not one on the other side at all.
          After it was cured of them on the one side, and the child was
        well again perfectly, it broke out of the other side with the smallpox as full as before and my brother Portington had much to
           do to save her from death. This was counted a strange accident.
          But, within a while, this mother — who had in so vile
           a manner abused myself and child and Mr Comber — fell very
        sick of a strong fever and had the advice of the doctor and my
        brother Portington and all the means could be to save her
           life, but it would not do. And when she saw she must 
           die, she cried out, to many that was present (her husband
        being one) that she was damned for what she had done to
        wrong myself and Mr Comber in these lies she had heard and
           had reported them though she knew we did not deserve them.
           And she was now damned for them if we did not forgive her.

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.67&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 67</a>






         And begged of God and us to forgive her and, if we would not
           forgive her, she was damned for them. And it was long of her mistress
           which set her on against us and, for Christ his sake, begged that I and
          he would forgive her and pray to God to forgive her.
         
         
           After I heard of this sad confession, and yet just one from
           my gracious <span class="evquote">Father of mercies</span>, I could not refrain from giving
          glory to the <span class="evquote">great and mighty God of heaven who had given hope 
          of repentance</span> to this <span class="evquote">miserable sinner</span>, who had done these sins
          with a high hand against us by which God was so much dishonoured
          and our <span class="evquote">good names</span> wronged and her soul endangered.
          Being, also, a clear evidence of the great judge of heaven,
           his mercy to us and judgement upon the wicked: to make this
          woman's own mouth to condemn her, and to do us right by the same
          tongue she had slandered us to make a public confession of her sin
          and acknowledge her guilt in our innocency and injury.
         
           Which was by the mighty power of God, the conviction of 
          her own conscience, made to confess the truth of her false
           accusation, lies and forgeries against me and him, and that for these
           her sins — against her knowledge and us — God, in his divine wisdom,
           by this sickness and her approach of death, would not let her go
           out of this world before she had cleared our wronged innocency.
          Acknowledging that she was damned for those horrid slanders
          and inventions of the Devil to make us odious before men, when
          her tongue was made use of against those that feared God.
          Therefore, in her agonies, forced to beg God's pardon and us to 
          forgive her and to pray for pardon for her, for Christ his sake, or else
           she deserved and should be damned for her false accusation.</span>
          When I was told of this extraordinary way of punishment,
           which the Lord chose to punish her sin and confess his justice therein,
           it could not but work a great terror in my soul to see the
           great reward of sin here and without true repentance hereafter.
          And that the Lord would choose this way to bring her to repentance
           here, that she should not be damned hereafter,
          makes me call to mind the Lord God, his dealing with his servant,
           Job, who had been buffeted by many and great temptations and storms
           by Satan to try his faith and patience under great trials both
           by his enemies, his friends. His own wife — in the midst of his calamities — bid him, '<span class="quote">Curse God and die</span>'.
          <span class="quote">His friends accused him of sins and wickedness</span>; <span class="quote">called him a
           hypocrite</span> and <span class="quote">a dissembler</span> and <span class="quote">one that had forsaken God</span>; all these and
           many more false lies and accusations, did the devil raise up against his righteous soul to make him sin against God and to
           provoke his God against him to destroy him.

         And of all the calamities fell upon him, we find none was
         more piercing and pungent than what his wife and friends
           had put upon him. <span class="quote">To the first, he answered: she spoke like one
           of the fools</span>. <span class="quote">What, shall we receive good at the hand of God,
         and shall we not receive evil</span>?

         
           To his friends' calumnies they charged him with, he answered : '<span class="quote">have pity upon me</span>, oh, my friends, for the hand of
           God is upon me'. <span class="quote">In all this, Job sinned not with his mouth nor
           charged God foolishly</span>. Thus, did the Lord endow his faithful
           servant, Job, to suffer patiently what he pleased to lay on him
           and, at length, <span class="quote">did bring him out of all his calamities</span>.
          He was pleased to justify his integrity against his friends
          and caused them to make submission and acknowledgement
           of their sins and their false accusations of him, and <span class="quote">to beg
           of Job to pray for them: for him, I will hear for you</span>.
          <span class="quote">Oh, how wonderful are the mercies of our great God</span>?
          <span class="quote">His ways are past finding out</span>: <span class="quote">shall mortals contend
           with God</span>, <span class="quote">or the clay to the potter, what hast thou made</span>?
         
           Much less shall <span class="quote">dust and ashes</span> contend with his Creator.
           Thy ways are too wonderful for me, I cannot find them
           out or who can do as thou dost, <span class="quote">O God, fearful in praises
           and doing wonders</span>? Oh, who am I, sinful <span class="quote">dust and ashes</span>,
          that thou should hear my prayers, or tears or groans of
           so vile a creature as I am. <span class="quote">And yet by thee, O Lord, alone
           I live and move and hath my being</span>.
          And to the praises of thy holy name will I give all
           glory for evermore: who hath let this poor sinner see her
           sins and wickedness against those she hath wronged, and in a 
           manner commanded her to confess, to thy glory, her sins
          and to cry out earnestly for pardon and forgiveness of us for
           them, and to beg our prayers to thee for pardon, for Christ his sake.
          Oh, blessed be thy holy name, O Lord, in giving her
          this grace of conviction, confession and repentance for what
          she did so wickedly against us. And I humbly pray
           for the <span class="quote">forgiveness of all those evils done against us</span>: pardon
          and wash away her wickedness in the blood of our dear and
           blessed Lord, our saviour, and receive her to thy mercy. Forgive
           also, O Lord, all the rest of our slanderers and those which has done us
           wrong. Grant them grace to repent and do thou please to pardon
          that none may be damned for their sins against me but give me
           grace to pray for them and pardon me, O Lord, my God. Amen.

           Oh, my God, I humbly beg of thy glorious mercy to pardon and forgive
           all my impatience and ungovernable sorrow, which came on me for the loss
           of <span class="quote">my holy good name, which thou hadst given me all my days and that great
           and precious ointment</span> I enjoyed (being the comfort of my life in all
           my other afflictions).
          But this, being so falsely imputed upon thy handmaid, without
           any cause or tendency, could not but be <span class="quote">more bitter than death</span>, which
          I had much rather have chosen that I might have given up my body to
           my heavenly Father undefiled, <span class="quote">without the very spot of uncleanness
           or immodesty</span> (having ever made it my endeavour to walk before
          God in what estate of innocency I was capable
               

            in this life, <span class="quote">ever endeavouring to keep my conscience void of offence, both before God and
           man</span>, for which grace I humbly bless and praise the Lord forever).
          Oh, my God, I beseech
               

             thee to pardon my want of faith to 
           mourn as if there was no hope for the resurrection of this, thy mercy,
           by restoring this, thy good name, given me and my want of consideration how thy servant, Job, was so afflicted by the devil and his own
           friends; for I was not worth to be named with him, thy true
           servant, who thou, the righteous judge, had known his integrity.
          <span class="quote">And, in the midst of his trials, made a way for him to escape</span>
           both those <span class="quote">fiery darts of the devil</span> and the malice of his friends, who
           then was turned his persecutors.
         
            But blessed be the name of my God, who did not forsake
          him in his extremity, but <span class="quote">caused his friends to make their
          confession to that servant of thine, and commanded them to ask
          him forgiveness, to themself, O Lord, for their sin against 
            thy majesty and against thy servant, Job</span>  (who
           they had traduced and slandered with their tongues, and had
          dishonoured thy name in him and <span class="quote">who had not spoken
           right of thee, O Lord, as thy servant, Job, had done</span>).
         
           So, O Lord, most graciously hast thy goodness done to
          me thy poor handmaid, had pity on me and not to suffer
          me to die by their cruelty, or to despair of thy mercy towards me
           (to whom I put my cause to deliver me from those lying inventions
           of the wicked against my innocency and my life).
         
    <span class="event" id="ev77-start">
         
           But now, in this great and glorious instance of thy mercy, did
          make this dying woman to give thee the glory of thy truth in the confession and clear acknowledgement of her heinous crimes and guilt of
           thy severe judgement against such sins. <span class="evquote">And that she was then to
           undergo the wrath and judgement for this, her sins</span>.
          And to let her see no salvation for her soul, but <span class="evquote">by her true and

           unfeigned repentance for them</span> and begging thy pardon for them.
           And not only confessed her sins before thy majesty, but
           also cried out to beg pardon of myself and Mr Comber (to
           who she had done these great wrongs in slanders) that we
          would forgive her sins against us and beg thy mercy to 
          forgive her, without which she might receive that heavy doom
               

             of thy 
          judgement: damnation forever.</span>
         
         
           Oh, my God, what shall I render to thy glorious mercy for
          thy judgement and thy mercy: judging this sinner and making thy
          mercy to appear in it to her soul that she might escape the eternal
           severity of <span class="quote">thy wrath</span> upon such sins and give glory with her mouth
          by the making such a public confession.
         
              Thy mercy is inexhaustible, infinite and incomprehensible
          to me, and this poor man, who was condemned by the world by these
           evil tongues and others, who thou, O Lord, didst make them to give
          the same testimony of thy truth in our vindication as she has done.
          And, as is thy judgement, so is thy mercy towards the <span class="quote">sons of
           men</span>. Thou, O Lord, <span class="quote">knew our integrity as thy servant Job</span>
           and didst, in thy due time, make thy name to be glorified by the
           confession of thy truth. Oh, that I and mine may never
           forget what thou, O Lord, most holy and most just, has done for us
           in this great and wonderful manner to justify thy poor servants'
               

          
          innocency and make us to be restored in this miraculous manner
          to the comfort of thy salvation.
         
          I see it is not in vain to trust in thy name, for <span class="quote">thou art
           a God that hearest prayers: to thee, all flesh shall come</span>. Oh, let this
          <span class="quote">servant rejoice in thy salvation and let not the mouth of the
          wicked prevail over me</span> who thou hast delivered by thy great
           might and power. But <span class="quote">let me, and all mine who thou hast given
          me</span>, be instruments of thy glory and praise to live up to the great
           precepts of thy holy gospel and be a means to establish thy glory
          in this life to all generations to set forth thy praise forever and
           forever in this <span class="quote">land of our nativity</span>.
         
          
           Oh, be pleased to establish that good work, which I hope thou

           
           hast begun in my family, of planting thy gospel in the settlement
           of thy church in this place and amongst my children (who thou,
           O Lord, hath vouchsafed to give thy handmaid).
          For whose sake, in these great things both as to temporal
           and spiritual concerns, O my God, thou hast moved my heart to
          strive after, and <span class="quote">been pleased to suffer me to be a partaker of thy
           sufferings</span>, to have crosses and disturbances in the prosecution of this
           good design and in much abundant mercy, has <span class="quote">hitherto

           up against me. But, by the almighty power of thy majesty,
           has defeated all those ill designs, and made thy glory to appear
           in my great deliverance as thou, <span class="quote">O Lord, did to thy servant, Job,
          to bring his enemies to shame, and made his innocency appear to the
          whole world and his integrity to be justified against all the false
          accusations of the devil</span>, who is thy enemy and <span class="quote">the father of lies</span>.
         
          Oh, my God, be pleased still in mercy to take care of my
           poor soul, and of my poor children's, and let us be still <span class="quote">preserved

          
           through faith to salvation</span> to glorify, praise, honour and adore
          thy name to all eternity, and still to <span class="quote">hold fast that faith that
           was once delivered to thy saints</span>. And that for his sake, who
           suffered for sin and sinned not — even <span class="quote">the Lord Jesus Christ, his
           sake</span>, <span class="quote">thy only son, in whom thou art well pleased</span> — in whose
          name I humbly crave pardon for these weak prayers and
           beg these petitions,  and whatever else thou seest fit in thy wisdom
           to bring us to thy kingdom. In whose name, I give thee praise
           in that absolute form of prayer which he hath taught us saying:
          '<span class="quote">Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy
            name. 
           Amen</span>', et cetera.

         
           Forasmuch as I was, by divine providence, disposed
           in marriage so remote from all my own relations and friends,
           whereby I might be in a suffering condition for the want of
          their advice and assistance either in my temporal affairs and spiritual,
          I was hereby exposed, as a stranger, to the several humours
           of those factious spirits which was altogether fixed — amongst
          whom I lived and was placed — there being not any of the
           profession of the Church of England.

         
           As for the first match of Mr Thornton's father, being all strict
          papists, so opposite to our faith, and both to interest concerns, whose
          daughters carried off a great part of estate from Newton by the
           large portions having £1500 a piece, being three of them matched to
           the best gentlemen of the country. Papists: videlicet, the Cholmeleys
           of Brandsby (£800  per annum) the eldest daughter was married to;
           the second daughter, my sister Margaret, was married to Mr
             Crathorne of Crathorne (of £800  a year, per annum);
           the third daughter, my sister, Anne, married to Mr Langdale in
           Holderness (of the best family of that name) and had as much estate
          at their sisters of a good house and quality.
          All so well disposed of, with good portions out of the estate, and yet
           had more expectancies of enjoying the whole, as heirs, if their father

         had not married again after their mother's decease, who,
           on her death bed, got her husband to settle such vast fortunes
           upon her daughters even to the ruin almost of his estate.

         
           (But great and beautiful woods was destroyed at Newton
           and cut down to pay them portions, which disfaced that land.)

         
           But, after his first wife's death, Mr Thornton was
           advised by his friends to marry a second wife, Sir Richard
             Darley of Buttercrambe, his eldest daughter: a very good
           and virtuous woman by whom he had four sons and two daughters.
          All of which had portions out of my husband's estate of
           about £1500 (besides maintenance and education) and my
          mother had a fair jointure of all Leysthorpe and but a portion
          of about £400
           (as I have heard, if ever was paid).
         
          All these were brought up in the way of strict presbyterians. Sir Richard Darley, being with his family and sons actually in
           the way of the Long Parliament and, I fear, had too deep a
           hand in the Scotch faction and bringing them into England
          to reform this church in the way of rebellion and Scotch
           presbytery (enemies to our church, episcopacy and the kingly
           government).
        
        
         
    <span class="event" id="ev81-start">
         
           In this juncture of time was my fortune to be amongst
          them, and how I came to bring myself into it, I have made
           a full relation before (when my marriage was laid in the
          scale to redeem my dear brother's estate from that
          tyranny of our oppression by the sequestration of all that was a
          friend to loyalty, or the church of God then established
           in England).
         
         
           But, since I was thus disposed, it became my duty
          to stand my ground, in a strange place and amongst a strange
           people, and that I was resolved to do — by God's grace and divine
           assistance — never to yield to temptations of either faction.</span>
         
         
           And though I had so great trouble upon me to defend
          the interest of my poor children in the right establishment of
           the estate upon them — as I have declared in part in this Book
           but, more at large, the several relations mentioned in some 
          papers of collections from the first alterations from the articles
           of my marriage — 

         
           yet, these things did not sink so deep with me as
          the danger I should leave them in, in point of their being right
           principled in matters of faith and doctrine of the true, orthodox
          religion here established, and of which I ever owned myself

           to be a true professor and a faithful member and, therefore, could
          not be any way acceptable to any of the other dissenters <span class="event" id="ev82-start">when I
           first came hither to Oswaldkirk. The house not ready at Newton,
           we were under my brother Denton's ministry there,
         
           who was a very good man and a good preacher but was only
           ordained by the presbytery ordination, and so I durst not adventure to receive the Holy Sacrament of him at that time (not being
           episcopal ordained).</span>
         
           <span class="event" id="ev83-start">
           Wanting that benefit of my salvation, which I thirsted after
           this two years, after the death of my dear mother, until by God's blessing
          I had the happiness to receive it first at my own house at Newton
           by Dr Samways (as I have related it in this Book, with my humble
           gratitude to God for that inestimable benefit of my redemption).</span>
         
         
    <span class="event" id="ev84-start">
         
           Nor had I the opportunity to receive the Holy Sacrament
           after this time, until, by providence, Mr Bennett came to Stonegrave
           and gave me it the first time in that church about Easter, 1663.</span>
         
         
           So that I wanted the chief food of my soul to comfort and
           strength my faith and nourish me up to life everlasting;
         
           having all that time been exercised with many crosses and accidents
           happening from those which was opposite to my faith and religion,
          which

            I was like to undergo with great difficulty (being exercised with 
          variety of humours, interests and suspicious eyes as well on the account
          of my differing in judgement, and for my assiduous care to
           prevent the ruin of my children by the alteration of settlements).
         
    <span class="event" id="ev85-start">
         
           So, this continued to my great trouble until by God's great
           goodness and providence, who provides a salve for every sore, did
           look on my affliction with pity and caused Mr Bennett (which was
           then our minister by the king's gift
               

            of Stonegrave living) did see
         
           it fit to send us his curate to officiate in his stead in this parish, and
           who constantly preached and baptised, and delivered the Holy Sacrament.
          Mr Bennett gave my husband a most excellent character
           of his learning, abilities for God's service and his gifts in preaching,
          with a very high encomium of his worthiness to perform that holy
          function
               

            which, though he was young, yet he was able to perform duty as
         
          ably as those which was much elder.
          When my dear husband had received this letter of recommendation, it made him more acceptable (from so grave a person as Mr Bennett)
           and much more satisfied, and all the parish, with Mr Comber after he
           preached his first sermon (Text: Psalm 19:7)
           which he made an excellent piece of work of it, which Mr Thornton and the
          whole parish highly commended and had ever after a great opinion
         
          of him.

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.74&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 74</a>






            

         The time which Mr Bennett sent him to Stonegrave was in
           the year 1663, about the month of October.
          After he was received into the parish and preached constantly
           both ends of the day. Besides constant prayer on Fridays and on
          Wednesday, he expounded methodically upon every holiday
          throughout the year and catechised all the children and youth
           in the whole parish (which we had not been used to the good way
          though much desired it) and the youth much improved by his catechising.</span>
         
         
    <span class="event" id="ev86-start">
          At the first he was tabled at Stonegrave at George Masterman's;
            
           from thence, he removed to mess to Mr Tully's, who was much in
           love with his person and preaching; so, continued for some time there,
           which was a great deal of pains he took, in coming from thence
           to Stonegrave so often in a week (being two miles from the church),
          which my dear husband considered to be too much to
           hinder and break his studies. Withal, I have heard him say: it
           
             was a great pity that he was obliged to be with such a kind of
         
          a rude house and too much company, and such as was not so fit
          for him being a scholar and a civil man, did much conserve that his
         
          circumstances should not be better accommodated than he could
           be in that house.
         
           Besides, he — having a value for his learning and parts and
           ingenuity — would make him a very good companion to divert

         
          him in his retiredness and too serious a temper, which he was
          naturally troubled with sometimes when he was vexed about the
          suits and encumbrances on him by that deed of Mr Norton's
           assignment.
         
           So, consulting with my brother Denton of this affair,
          it was concluded to make the motion from Mr Thornton
          that he should be invited to come to have his table at
           Newton, which my husband would give him with a horse to
           be kept winter and summer, if he would please to come and
          live with him and to perform family duties of prayers and
           catechising the children.
         
           Which motion was accepted of, on both sides, and was
          concluded on betwixt them before I ever heard anything
           of the matter until he was to come by my husband's order.
         
         
           But I hope, in God, this was so ordered by providence
          that those good offices was performed by his endeavours,
               

             which was
         
           an occasion of a blessing upon this family, and instruction of them
           and teaching them  in the way of piety and religion. My
         
             dear husband being well pleased in his cheerful company,


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.75&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 75</a>






           reading, study and other pleasant accomplishments, which
           diverted him and very acceptable to his genius, besides the daily
          performances of prayers and reading the scriptures and repetitions of
          sermons. All which things was very acceptable both to God and
           good Christians, with great comfort to ourselves and children.
         
    
          Mr Thomas Comber came to live at Newton with Mr
           Thornton about the time of March the 19th, 1665, and so continued (and was here at Mr Thornton's death) in a painful
          way of studying and reading, improving himself in his studies in
           this retired course of life. And, in this place, he began and finished
          his learned books of meditations upon the liturgy of the
            Church of England (The Companion to the Temple and Altar).
         
         
         
           Which pious pieces of work, I hope God had given a blessing to
          and has been a means to bring in a great number of the dissenters from
           our church, which had so great prejudices against us for it that they
          would forsake our communion, nor by no means would either hear
          divine service but ridiculed, scorned and abused it,
          calling the whole service a dry morsel, cold meat. Nay, popish superstition, and so blaspheming that sacred order of our holy faith and church
           and the holy scriptures
             themselves, which is so fully proved to be the ground
         
          and substance of our devotions compiled into this set form for an
          excellent rule and guide to our public devotions.
          I hope as the benefit was great to Mr Comber to begin his first
           years and youth in this, our private family, in which he enjoyed the benefit
           of so early a study and ministry, so the blessing of God will, I hope, go
           along with his endeavours for the general good of souls in many thousands
          and conversion of many enemies.
          So, I hope also, he shall receive the due reward of his labours
           by converting of souls and bringing many to salvation, by the grace of God
          given by his means and endeavours.
         
    
         
           This was also one happy effect of this work begun at our house at
           Newton. That, whereas my dear husband had been brought up in a way
          of the presbyterian prejudice against this holy forms of prayers in our
           liturgy — and indeed, of all forms but what use in extempore by him
             and others —
         
         
           upon discourse with Mr Comber, and hearing his questions answered so
         well by him, he put him upon the first desire to hear what he could say
           by way of enlargement upon each of the prayers, which did give him
          so great satisfaction that he ever after had a more honourable esteem
          of our prayers and was willing that it should be used in our family.

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.76&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 76</a>






            

         And from thenceforth, did never neglect the receiving the
           Holy Sacrament with me at the church in public with the people
           and also in private with me in the house (upon occasion of
          my sicknesses or when we could not have opportunity to
          receive it at the church at our public

           communions).
         
         
           Which we never omitted — since Mr Comber came — to receive it four times in the year, which never had been done before but
           only at Christmas and Easter.
          But he brought them to four times in the year: videlicet, at Easter,
           at Whitsuntide, at Michaelmas (after the gathering in of the fruits
          of the earth to return God our thanksgivings for his blessings of the
          fruits of the earth) and then at Christmas.</span>
         
         
           Having been so large upon this subject of having the
          blessing of God bestowed upon this family and parish wherein
           I live, I cannot withhold myself from doing that duty,
          which I owe so much to my heavenly Father — which so bountifully
          has answered my prayers and granted my humble requests in the
           best and choicest of his blessings — which I cannot sufficiently glorify
          his holy name for while I have breath.
          He saw my distress, my fears for my children's being right
           instructed in the ways of true faith and religion, and behold
          the immense goodness of our God, who sees what is fit for me and
          mine, and grants what his wisdom knows fit to bring us to his
          salvation.
      
          And by an unexpected providence for both my dear children's
          right instruction in the true faith of the gospel, and for the bringing
          in my dear husband's judgement to be convinced of his
           error; and making him conformable to so good and laudable forms
          of our most excellent prayers of the church, together with his full
           satisfaction of the necessity of receiving the Holy Communion of
          the Lord Jesus Christ.
          Giving us withal the happy opportunity of our children's good
          instruction and our families by prayers and catechising them all
           before the receiving the Holy Sacrament. He was also very diligent in private prayers with us upon any sicknesses or troubles
          upon Mr Thornton, myself and children.
         So that my husband took great delight in his facetious
             company
         
          and exercise of his religion and ingenuity, and several times
           would say to me and others that Mr Comber — being a man that took
           such delight in his studies and learning so young — he was confident,


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.77&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 77</a>






         being a man of such learning and parts, would come to great
           preferment in the church if not to be a bishop.
         
    <span class="event" id="ev89-start">
         
           About the year 1666, his time was completed. He was to commence Master of Art, going up to Cambridge to take his degree,
           being of Sidney College, where he was much admired and did
          come off with great applause; having been assisted to that work
           by some of Mr Thornton's friends, who was kind and loved him
           for his preaching.
         
          There was much discourse then, when he was at London, that
          Mr Bennett would only leave a curate at Stonegrave to read prayers
           and give about £10 a year to officiate that place, and so to save
           the £30  a year which he now gave to Mr Comber. (He, giving in all to
          him £40
           per annum.)
         
          Upon which, Mr Thornton was so much concerned that I heard
          him affirm; if we might not enjoy Mr Comber still and a preaching
           ministry, he would not live at Newton but go where he might
          enjoy it elsewhere.
          About Whitsuntide, 1666, Mr Bennett came to Stonegrave in
           order to receive his tithes then due and brought one Mr Roose with
          him to assist him in that business of the parish.
        
          My dear husband — finding Mr Bennett's inclination to do as
           before expressed and that nothing but fair terms could do with him,
          and having a particular respect for Mr Comber — consulted with my brother
            Denton, a wise and prudent person, what to do in this case; who, upon mature
           deliberation, judged it the best way to obtain his desire in providing
          for his own satisfaction in that point
          was to see if Mr Bennett might be prevailed with to let my dear
           husband a lease of the living for 21 years, or his life to pay him the
           rent of £100 per annum and to find a supply of a minister to preach and to
          perform all duties belonging it.
          They came at length to this conclusion, and a lease to be drawn up
          in order to have the lease to be made in order to a resignation
           of the living afterwards, but Mr Bennett's letter (dated: June 26, 1666)
          speaks more at large to Mr Thornton about it which he was to assign
          over to my husband.
          But, being that year's tithes due to Mr Bennett then, he would
           not sign a lease until he had that rent of £100 paid to him,
           which Mr Thornton did not know of neither anyone but myself, and Mr
             Bennett and brother Denton who paid it from me, which I did to a good
          end to obtain the settlement of so good provision for the gospel and
          this family which £100
           was paid this year (June 1666, the 25th) as appears
           by Mr Bennett's acquittance of that date (June 25th,
             1666).

         After this matter was stated about the living, and Mr Thornton had
           obtained a lease and resignation of this living of Mr Bennett (the
          charges whereof was most of it discharged by me), both myself and
          husband was very diligent and industrious to get the presentation
           granted of the king, who, by the great affection his majesty, King
             Charles II,
           bore to my uncle, my Lord Frescheville,
         
          he obtained the grant of it for Mr Comber to succeed Mr Bennett
           after his decease, which by God's blessing we did obtain. Indeed, there
          was many obstacles and hindrances met withal in the way to hinder
           it, but at length, by great struggle, the Lord granted to have it
           obtained to the great satisfaction of my dear husband and the parish.
          But, before this business of the living happened, Mr Comber,
           being then at London and knew nothing of it until, at his return
          home, he called at Southwell and was entreated by Mr Bennett to bring
          down the lease from him to my husband.
         </span>
         
         
    <span class="event" id="ev90-start">
          He had received a letter from Mrs Anne Danby, who was then
           his great friend (pretended so, however) whose advice he was ever
           inclined to observe, as from a wise and prudent friend; in her letter,
           dated ,
           told him he might, in her judgement, be a very
         
          happy man in a wife if he could prevail to obtain in marriage
           for her cousin, Alice, which was very promising and virtuous. And though
           she was a little too young, yet a few years might work that
           and her parents, having so much respect for him, it might be
           very advantageous for him to settle himself in this place
          where they would be industrious to promote him to as great
          preferment than elsewhere and much more to this purpose
          (which she had conjectured by discourses from us).
          She, then, having made this motion from herself to
          Mr Comber then as well as long before — that had encouraged him
           to begin this suit, which he had done so long since as when my
             children was at York for to learn qualities (when Hannah,
               my maid, waited upon them, and can witness the same by his
           frequent letters and tokens, and his often treats of them as the dates
           of all those letters may testify to each other and that by my consent)
           — how then, with what impudence and treachery to me and my
          husband, and these two who she had encouraged and begun this design of a marriage betwixt us all, could she afterwards
           sit as a judge against us in hearing and repeating such horrid
          lies was forged against us and not to vindicate our honours
           against all such, with detestation to resist and stop their mouths,
          by declaring the truth of her knowledge or to have told me
          and my husband or Mr Comber of them?

    <span class="event" id="ev91-start">
         
           Since, then, it was our desire and design to place Mr Comber in this
           living at Stonegrave (thereby to have it supplied by a settled preaching minister, and one whom my husband had pitched upon with a
           further desire to dispose our daughter to in marriage, if God should
           bless them with life)
         
           this was the true reason which induced me and my dear husband to take such particular care to provide for him; both for
           the comfort we had from his ministry, as also for the hopes of
           future satisfaction by the disposal of our dear child so near us.
         
           And I did not only disburse this £100 to Mr Bennett as mentioned but much more monies out of my own particular estate.
          And I was compelled to borrow these £100  which was to pay Mr Bennett his
           first rent due out of Stonegrave for his tithes (then payable at that
           midsummer 1666) of my tenants at Middleham (which I afterward
          did allow that in the rents, besides the money Mr Thornton was to
          pay him of £100  per annum and which Mr Thornton did never pay or allow
          one penny of it, nor anyone else, before Mr Bennett would
           grant to sign a lease to my husband in order to a resignation).
         
           Nor did I ever expect any satisfaction for this £100  or of any
           other monies laid out about the procurement of the presentation,
           or of that concern from Mr Comber or Mr Thornton (though it has been
          to a considerable value) hoping to see the comfort fulfilled in that
          good work which God had given me leave to begin for the good of
          many souls, as well as my own family.
         
         
          For the first cause and the last end of all my undertakings in this
           great design — for the establishment of the true faith of our church
           in this place — was
             for the glory of God in the salvation of souls.
         
         
    
         
           And as I have mentioned formerly, my dear husband, by God's
          blessing and mercy to me, did join with me in this; having a great
          desire to have purchased the perpetual advowson of this living
           of Stonegrave to annex it to his estate by my Lord Frescheville's
           means (could have it done for £300  but my lord told him it
           would be changed at every king's change, so he laid down that
           design of that).
          But we were very ready to show our endeavours to bring him
           into the way and eye of preferment and, to that end, I made it my request
           to my dear Lord Frescheville to accept Mr Comber for his chaplain,
          which he pleased to do for my sake and gave him a confirmation by
           his patent.

    <span class="event" id="ev93-start">
          Yet, I must confess, I had no thoughts of disposing of my
          daughter so soon in marriage. But then I heard Mr Thornton had
          been advised to cut off the entail of Covill's deed a little before his
           going to Stearsby (and finished that deed there in
           1685
            
           and unsettled all
         
          the estate of Leysthorpe from my children) which put me upon the match,


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.80&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 80</a>






            
           

         with great trouble for this alteration, considering since his being
          so afflicted with the

            sad distemper of the palsy, which was like to have killed
         
           him every month with new relapses (notwithstanding all means I
           did use and the doctor, which was a great heartbreak to me for him).
         
          I could not hope to recover myself of that dreadful sickness I
           had upon me in 1666 — by reason of grief I took upon the entail
           being cut off reduced me to a miscarriage in August 1666 — having little
           hopes of my own life or continuance of my husband's.
          And then, if we both should be taken away from our dear
          children, what a condition then might we leave our children
          and estate in, and what a confusion might rationally

             be thought
         
           to follow upon them, our poor posterity?
          These afflicting circumstances obliged my care for all
          of my children and did hasten my closing with this motion
           formerly begun of Mr Comber, and hoped that by this means — of
          choosing so understanding and discreet a husband for my eldest
          child — he would certainly have a tender care and concern for my
            young son (then but four years old) in his education and principles
           of religion, as well as of his care of my two poor daughters.
          So that, after the discovery of Covill's deed being destroyed,
           Mr Thornton's sickness of palsy and my great danger of death as before,
           it hastened the proceedings. And articles of marriage proceeded with
           Mr Comber, made with as much advantage as could to secure both
          her portion and other dues to herself and children, together with very
          kind terms for my dear son not to demand her portion
           until he should be able to pay it, if after Mr Thornton's decease.
         
           These proceedings in this match, Mrs Danby fully knew and was a
          witness to our agreement, and also that I was compelled to advise and
          make Mr Comber privy concerning the settlement of the estate of the
           Leysthorpe estate for my children (after Covill's was cut off). And
           did send him, as a friend, to consult with counsel for the making a
          new deed of settlement spoken of before, which was the last done before I
           fell sick of my last child; having no friend or relation with me,
          did employ him about all such concerns, which was made a false use
          of against me and my innocent and great business of my family.
      </span>
         

          But my gracious <span class="quote">God, who searchest all hearts and triest all imaginations</span>, saw my sorrows and sufferings, and did bring me out
          of these fears and provided a good settlement for them.
          And knew what emergencies I was cast into and did at
          length <span class="quote">bring me forth from being swallowed by sorrows,
          though I waded through deep waters of afflictions</span> and in the mire of
           desperate trials by the <span class="quote">scourge of malicious tongues</span>; even for
          the discharge of my duty to my husband and children was I thus
           persecuted by hell and <span class="event" id="ev94-start">by those I had fed at my table, and clothed
           with my wool and succoured in all distresses (as witness this woman's
          many letters of thanks for many years together until she turned my
           unjust enemy for her sister turning her out for her ill tongue).</span>

         Had not this deceitful person a design to have taken
           this opportunity to break this match, and that in the most base
           and scandalous way imaginable, taking this advantage — by
           the concealment of this intended match — to bring her own end
           about: to make us to be forced to keep her who had disobliged
          her sister-in-law and abused her with her tongue and turned herself
           off there for her own and maid, Barbara's, odious railing.
         
          
           <span class="event" id="evn9-start">
           Since which time of her being discarded from Bedale, where Madam
           Danby had kept her and her family several years at £60 a year and,
           after Tom Danby died, she would have given her the same or more
          upon my solicitation for her to her sister. But she would not accept
            
          under £80  a year, upon which refusal of Madam Danby's kindness she
           did utterly forsake her which was by her own wilful act.</span>
         
          
           <span class="event" id="evn10-start">
           Yet, out of a cunning

           deceit, would force me to have kept her
         
           forever (as she did basely tell my aunt Norton afterwards). And,
          by this horrid way of slander, imagined I must be obliged to
           her to clear my reputation by whose secret malice I had been
          so grievously abused.
         
          Her design was very evident, enough. For, after my dear
          husband had turned her out of my house for her wicked ingratitude
         
           to me and her sins against my honour and innocency (which she was convinced of in her conscience) and she wanted my daily supply to maintain
           her with all things out of my poor patrimony of my own,
          this woman made her complaints to her brother, Francis
           Danby, at York

             and sent him to Newton to move my brother Den
         ton  to be a means to bring her into my house and favour. And if I
           would receive her again into my house as formerly, she both
           could and would vindicate my honour and innocency to all the
          world.
        
         
           But when I heard of this, her motion, and upon the design
            
          of gaining her point, I returned this answer to them who toulden
            
          me: that, as I bless God, I had never done anything to blast them
           reputation or honour in any circumstance of my life, and I durst
           appeal to God and her own conscience in it for the truth thereof.
         </span>
         

         
           How durst she all the while have taken part with those which
          forged those lies against me
             and be
            not like a good Christian to justify
           me against them! Nay, she encouraged them in the slanders, and bated
           me like a dog before her like a most ungrateful and unworthy wretch.
          And, as I had been preserved from that death designed for me, so
           I did not doubt but my gracious God would vindicate and <span class="quote">judge my
          cause</span> without her doing it. And I did not need that tongue to

           clear my innocency which had been the chiefest cause of my wrong.
          And hoped in God, I and mine shall be delivered without
           her now, who would not speak for me when she might —
          as it seems she could have done — by her knowledge of
           our concerns.
         
          But I fear there was much of <span class="quote">the old serpent</span> in
           this plot — to have gained that design to show the world
           by my entertaining her again — that I could not have
           made out my innocency without bringing her in to do it,
           who was the main instrument of my slanders, and of
          being set on work of hell to have prevented that good
           design of planting the true faith in my family, and so
           have by her means — a second
           time — have destroyed my hopes

         
          and the preservation of my family to be secured.

           For she did, after she was gone from hence, try to
          her utmost to instigate all my good friends against
          me and my child by stirring up my good friend Dr
          Samways to believe those lies told against Mr Comber
          by Mary Plewes.
         
          And having done that, then (out of her malice by
          that means) work upon my Lady Yorke in such
          a sort that she would resolve to have stolen my dear
            child from me (under pretence to have had her to be
           confirmed) and so have kept my daughter from me.
         
           But this bait was discovered by my dear aunt Norton
           and so declared by her to my faithful friend Daphne, who
           gave me speedy notice and, I bless God, did prevent it.</span>

           Thus, did this woman requite my kindness and charity who
          I had for 20 years space been her continual daily and faithful
           friend, as I have made some remarks in my 'First Book of
             Widowed Condition' set down. But a longer account I
          was forced to give of my disbursements, and maintaining of
           herself, husband and children on all accounts, whatever, for
           the space of 20 years; they, being cast out of favour by
          Sir Thomas Danby on her inveigling his son to marry her
           in Virginia and her pride afterwards (declared by Mrs Batt to me).

          her occasions and necessities and her family

             above £400
             which was
         
           out of my own patrimony given me by my dear mother,
          with household goods and all necessaries for house, meat and
           clothing, and in their tabling and expenses of journeys to
           get their estate again from Madam Danby which, by my

           did do. And also by my means did he make a deed of 
           assurance to his father for his relief, and his mother and his
           younger brothers' portions for them, when he should have 
          gotten the estate
          by the virtue of those settlements made before he got
           his father's estate. He, having been cheated of it (by Madam Danby
         
           her friends to make it over to her after her husband's death)
           which by my great endeavours, cost and pains I got her son

           get his estate again, he faithfully promised and did engage
          to pay me all that ever I had so kindly laid out for his father
            
           and mother and self anyway. And if I could have suspected
           his fidelity concerning his dues to me, I would have made
          him to have given bond as he was then willing.
          But not doing that, I, afterwards being in a great straits
           for some debts for my son Thornton. After he had gotten and enjoyed
           his estate by my means as aforesaid, I made some application
           to Sir Abstrupus Danby (in my distress for my son Thornton) for
           money to relieve him with, and showing my account laid out
          for himself and family to the sum of £400.
         
         
          Yet, I would have been contented to have accepted £150
            
           for it, paid in three years' time, if he would have done that. But he
          would not yield one penny more to relieve myself or my dear
            son but £50, which was gained with much endeavours by my son
              Comber, and that neither but upon my releasing all my other
           moneys which I had disbursed as before for himself and family,
         
         

          which is very hard measure, not to pay me what I was forced
          to borrow and pay interest for to relieve him and them from starving
          which just debts I now want to relieve myself in my needs.</span>
         
          Nor had I repeated this here but to show the great 
           ingratitude whereby I am requited. Besides the most horrid
          reward I had from his mother, who undermind my happiness and envied my comfort of that <span class="quote">good name</span> I had been blessed
           with (above many hundreds
             being the great comfort of my sorrows)
         
          that still it was my dear husband's and my joy in each
           other: we would  say, for all our afflictions and crosses, yet we

          must not forget or pass over in silence without expressions of
          most humble and hearty thanks and praises to the glory of our

           my great enemy, the devil, who could not prevail by all his
           temptations to make me so sin against my God.
          But, by the blasting of my good name, would make me appear
          odious to good people and a scorn to the wicked which rejoice at my

           enemies could say or do against me. And the more of their lies that
           they invented, the more he pitied me and loved me, and would often
           abuse and reproach Mrs Danby for her base,  and inhumane and unchristian
           dealing with me, and would never be satisfied until he had turned
          her out of his house.
         
          And when I had been overcome with sorrow and extreme weeping
           at my miserable misfortune — to be thus traduced by my friends and
           servants — he, dear heart, would often say to me: 'My dear joy,
          why doest thou thus lament and break my heart with
             sorrow for thee
         
          to see thou wilt not be comforted? Would I not spend my dearest
          blood to right thy cause and justify thy unspotted innocency?
          And I have examined these people which had heard them
           and they all, upon their oaths, clears thee from the least guilt
           or shows of evil by example, or words or anything, and all are sore
           grieved for those lies was told'.
          'And besides, I will make it my business diligently to find
          out those who has
             wronged thee and will certainly have them
         
           severely punished. Nay, God will revenge thy cause upon all
          those miscreants who has abused and injured thy precious <span class="evquote">good
          name</span>, and since I both know that business which we would not
           have made public (of the match of my child with Mr Comber)
          which you have had many occasions to employ him about our 
           estate and affairs — which none but my brother Denton and myself
          and Mrs Danby knows of — this might be some occasion that our
           enemies might pretend that you employed him'.
         
         
           'But Mrs Danby is most ungrateful and disloyal to thee: to know
           these things and would not discover them.
         
           And since you know my faithful heart and my confidence in
           thee, I pray thee, take comfort your own conscience and my endeared
           love to thee'. Much more comfortable words would this blessed man,
           my dear husband, comfort me and support my 
        [heart]
    
           in the midst of sorrows.
             </span>
         
         
           The third mercy, I humbly acknowledge from my gracious God,
           was that <span class="event" id="ev99-start">upon my brother Denton's examining (on my request)
          all the servants in the house what they ever did see or hear from me
          of any light or uncivil carriage, or knew anything of what was
           spoken against me (which he did) every one of them utterly denied that
          they had seen or heard from me anything but which was good and virtuous
           and was all extremely grieved at what was reported of any ill, for
           they was confident all lies and wished they might by punished.

           Thus, all the servants cleared me and themselves from doing
           me this injury, and hoped God would right me against all those
          which was my slanderers and abusers, for they were greatly grieved for
           my affliction.

           As for Danby and Barbery, her maid, who stood to their accusation of Barbery, one of the women of my house that went away
           from my service as her time was up. But I never had heard
           one word of this woman nor anyone else until now, which was two
          years and these miscreants kept it in their breast of their conjecture
           and evil surmises until they saw their own time. But I would
          not let this rest until Daphne had writ to her at London
           (where she was married to one had been put to a joiner trade
          and I had paid £16
           for his apprenticeship).
         
         
         
           To this Mary Breakes, Daphne writ to let her know that
           Mrs Danby had (and her maid, Barbery) laid many ill things to
            my charge, and said it was she that had told them of me
         
           that my mistress had robbed her husband and given all his money
          to Mr Comber with such like untruths.
          But this woman did justify me in all things, and said it
           was an odious lie to charge her with any ill concerning me; for
           she had never seen such by me in her life, and was very angry
           and sorry that they should abuse me, and lay it on her now
           she was gone and not to answer for herself (which letter is yet extant).</span>
         
          Thus, is my injuries reduced into a narrow room and by
          all examinations and inquiries may be laid at Mrs Danby's
           door, and then the result may conclude with the prospect of an
           inveterate malice, causelessly contracted.

           I must, therefore, bless the name of my God and <span class="evquote">Father of

            cry God for mercy and pardon for so wickedly hearing lies and

          they did not give me notice of it whereby I might have been
          sooner cleared of those slanders.
          Which on these people's true repentance, with many tears shed,
          I was moved and begged of God to forgive them the injuries was

         vouchsafed me that mercy and providence <span class="event" id="ev102-start">in order to clear my
           innocency from all those lying aspersions cast on my good name,
          and was spread as far as Richmond to the ears of my dear aunt
            Norton (who lamented much my misfortune: to have lived to the 42nd
           year of my life in an unspotted reputation and now to be seemed — by
         
           these lying tongues — to have been guilty of something unworthy of
           that noble race and virtuous that I came from).
       
          My dear aunt was so concerned to hear I had been so belied
           that she immediately came to Newton and found me in a manner
           half dead with grief, upon this alarm
             that Mrs Danby and her maid
         
           raised up against me.
         
               I was extremely overjoyed to see her and blessed God for that 
           providence which brought her thither though, at first, they had possessed
           her with some fears — though never of my giving cause of scandal — that
          I had been unfortunate in lighting upon some treachery from those
          of a contrary judgement.
         
           Indeed, her apprehension had some ground for it — being
           placed amongst so many contrary opinions, who was glad of
           any pretence to make me not so desirable — for those two factions (of
           popish and presbyterian) had been some occasion to choose a match for
           my daughter to secure my children from that education. This, joined
           with others' self-interests, which was contrary to mine, all made up a
          cabal with those of my enemies to take fire and spread my misfortune
           that was raised against me. 
         
         
            But then, an inward secret malice of her that should have
           been my compurgator —

             and have done me right by the discovering to me
         
           how I was wronged and in what manner — did not do so, but suffered
          me still to go on so slandered in my own house for two years together , which had been raised upon my securing my writings and money of
           my dear mother's (by Mr Thornton's order) with Mr Comber until it
           should please God I was delivered of that child which was my last.
         
           When my dear aunt understood all those bitter pills I had
           prepared for me, she very much commiserated my condition and did
          use her utmost endeavour to find out the injurious practices against
           me, nor would she be satisfied until my dear husband did quit the
           house of Madam Danby. (I have related the circumstances before.)
    

          Her zeal for my honour was truly good, and also to have as many to
           understand the wrong I had been under by such abominable slanders.
          and I bless God for her great pains and industry which she took in that
           affair, who made it her business to testify the truth in my behalf
          against all opposers.
         
           Thus, she played a true Christian's part to me in clearing my wronged
          innocency both to my Lady Wyvill, Mr Darcy, Dr Samways and 
           my Lady Yorke, who had been too much biased by Mrs Danby's stories.

         The excellent comfort, ease and refreshment I received from and
           by my dear aunt's counsels and prayers and good advice in my trouble,
          I have great cause to remember with highest gratitude to my heavenly
           Father who sent me such relief, I may say, from heaven; having
          a friend nearer than a brother which did succour me in this deep distress and when she brought Dr Samways
               

            with her to pray for me,</span>
         
           <span class="event" id="evn11-start">having stayed with me until she saw Mrs Danby sent away to York
           (which I did, and borrowed
               

           Mrs Graham's coach to carry her, with a maid
         
          to wait on her. I also took my last leave of her and gave
          her other £3
           to relieve her withal, added to the £5  I sent before to her,
          which made up the sum of £8
           which she had then).
         
         
           Beside all the attendance of my house and servants, she
           wanted for nothing I could do for her,</span> though she deserved it not
           to turn so much my deadly enemy — as much as in her laid —
           to despoil me of my precious honour. 
         
         
            But the mighty God of the distressed would not suffer me
         
           to perish in this gulf of sorrow, but sent me relief against
           her, who would have made a prey of me, for to make me still
           keeper after she had thus martyred me.
          
           My dear aunt did not only give me this comfort
           but, after she went home, did me all the good offices imaginable
            
          as to set all my friends aright in their judgement of all my
           actions, and cleared my innocency by relating those passages
          she observed and heard the matters carried at Newton.
           
          Oh, how can I sufficiently set forth the praise of the Lord
           or magnify his holy name, who did not suffer me to perish
          or my innocency to be too long wronged but sent his servant
           to do me this excellent kindness. Therefore, <span class="quote">will I praise the
           Lord forever, and with my mouth will I sing praises to his holy name</span>,
          who has delivered me thus far in all the passages of his providence
           to me, his unworthy creature. Oh, that the Lord would grant me
          his grace never to forget his goodness but live to his glory.
         
    <span class="event" id="ev103-start">
         
           At my dear aunt's going away, she sent my good friend,
           Daphne, to be with me and comfort me, which she did much in her
           pitying my distress and assist me in my weakness which this occasioned,
           falling into a flood on my grief and sorrow.</span> But <span class="event" id="ev103a-start">when she
           went home, which was a long time after she did her best to
          do me right with Mr Darcy, Mr Edrington and my cousin
            Nicholson, whose charity (though of another opinion) was much
          grieved at the unjust lies which was told of me at my Lady
            Frankland's (who was incensed against me that I would not
          let my servant leave me when I was in childbed and go to
           her). They, God forgive them, had hatched lies of me,

           which, when my cousin Nicholson, out of her charity, came
           to see me, told me of and examined the truth, and then declared
           the same at Newburgh, and Oulston and Thirkleby,</span> which I bless
           God, to put it into the hearts of my friends to pity my condition.
         
          Thus, have I cause to put my trust in <span class="quote">that mighty one
           of Israel</span>, who sees and hears the distress of his poor servant when
           hell had set forth his emissaries all over to dishonour my God,
           in me, his faithful servant.
          Then did his goodness dissipate these his designs and would not
           suffer my <span class="quote">good name</span> to rot but sent me great help from all
           places where I had been traduced,
               

             and my friends to justify my wrongs
         
           was wicked and showed what afflictions I laid under.
          Blessed be the glory of his great name, who gave me his persevering grace to keep and preserve my soul from this subtle and
           powerful and malicious enemy of God and all mankind, but most
           the enemy of those whose desire is to destroy the works of hell.
           Thou, <span class="quote">O Lord, most high</span> has now made thy power to appear
           by thy truth, magnifying the same in this great instance of my
           whole life and, by these great evidences of thy mercy, had more
          particular care of my soul and body of thy gospel and truth and
          has delivered me out of great temptation of the devil seeking to destroy me. But, oh, I will bless the Lord forever which hath delivered me
           from the malice of my enemies and the devil. Oh, let thy gospel
           flourish in this my family, and the true exercise thereof in despite
           of hell and his snares made for us, and let thy name be ever
           glorified in me and all my generations forever.
          
           Defend my cause, strengthen my faith and bring me out of all my
           trials and temptations, that like gold purified seven times in the fire,
          that I and mine may be
           great

         After, by great strugglings with my enemies, both public and
           private, and gotten some relief from them — as well to rectify
          the settlement of the estate and fixing it upon my poor
           posterity, and also to the divine assistance of my gracious
           God and heavenly Father (with the comforts I received from my
             dear husband and friends, <span class="event" id="ev104-start">drawing near my time to be
           delivered of my ninth child, my son, Christopher) —
         
           then a great concern came in place with me to
          consider of; in regard I passed so many dangers and
           difficulties in childbearing, I was much concerned how to
          have all the writings and evidences
             of the settlements of my
         
          dear mother's and my husband's estate, which I always had
          to keep in custody since my mother's death for the security
          of my dear children.
         
           And before I fell sick of my son, Robert, I delivered the
           little red trunk of my dear mother's — which she kept her writings
           in — to my cousin, Roger Covill, for safe custody until it pleased
           God I was recovered of my child and, then, he restored me them.
         
          But my cousin Covill being dead now and I, far of all
           my relations, was in a great strait who to entrust so great
          a concern withal for safety;
               

             being not willing to leave the
         
          said trunk in the hand of any stranger, and accounting my
            dear husband, my nearest and only interested for my children
          in case of my decease, I begged of my dear husband
          that he would please to take this trunk of my mother's,
           with all the writings, into his care and keeping, and to keep
          them for me and my poor children until it should please God
           to restore me again. But, if the Lord should take me away from himself and my children,
          I begged he would please to deliver this trunk (with
           the writings) unto my Lord Frescheville, who was my mother's
           brother and also her trustee and executor of her will and testament.
          I also desired my husband to deliver to my Lord Frescheville
           these monies, which he had the use of (which was my mother's)
           and he had given to me again to keep, but I gave them (being
          about £60
           or £70) praying him to give it to my Lord Frescheville for the
           use of my dear mother's will expressed for my children (as it
           may appear in her deeds and last will and testament, it did
          belong to my lord as her executor for the use of my children
           as by her will expressed).

         To which request of mine, my dear husband gave me this
           answer: 'My dear heart, I thank you for being so kind as to
           repose so much trust in me, as to leave the trunk of writings in my
           hand and your mother's money to keep for yourself and children'.
         
          'But I desire thee to excuse me for having them in my custody,
           the trunk of writings and your mother's money; for though I would do ten
          times more for thee and thine then that comes to,
         
          yet — if, in case God should take thee from me — I would not have
           them found with me because they concern thy children, and some of
           thy friends might think I had altered them or not done right
           to them. And I would avoid all suspicion'.
        
          Then, upon these words, I was much troubled to hear him say
           so, and could not refrain weeping at it, and said: 'Dear heart,
          if you would not keep these things yourself, yet I desire you
           would let my brother Denton keep them for me and my children'.
          But Mr Thornton prayed me not to think much with him; for
          my brother Denton must not have them neither, for the same reason
          he did not do it himself.
         
          But he would advise me to leave them all, both the trunk of
           writings and the money, with Mr Comber (both the money and writings
          of my mother's for my children in custody) to keep for me until it
           shall please God to deliver me and restore me again. And if it pleased God
           I recovered, as he hoped I should, then he to give them to me again.
          But, if otherwise and the Lord should take me away from him,
          he did promise me faithfully that he would take care that Mr
            Comber should deliver all safe into my Lord Frescheville's hand, as I desired, which had the most right to keep them as my mother's executor.
          When Mr Thornton had advised me thus, and it was his own mind
           to have me, and I could not prevail for himself or my brother Denton;
           but he ordered it to be so, I said I would do as bid me and give a strict
           charge about it to Mr Comber, according to his desire.
         
          After this, within a little time, I told him that Mr Thornton did
          desire he would do as much for me as to keep this same little trunk
           of writings, which concerned the estate, and settlement on my children —with all
          my dear mother's deeds and writings of her estate and settlement on my
          children, and the said sum of money of £60 or £70 in a canvas
           bag (which was my dear mother's) also for my children with the sum
           in coin that I desired of Mr Thornton —
          until it pleased God I was delivered of my child and restored again.
           But, if God should please to call for me out of this world, I desired him
           that he would be faithful to my husband, myself and my poor children,
          and deliver all things was committed
          to his charge safe into my dear
         
           Lord Frescheville's hand to be kept by him for the use of my dear children
           according to my mother's last will and testament.

         And I had also put into the said little trunk a will of my own,
          how to dispose of my dear mother's goods and monies to my
           children, according to her power given me by her own will, to
          dispose of them to such children as should be best deserving
           as she ordained me in and by her last will and testament.
         
          According to Mr Thornton's desire and mine to Mr Comber,
           he took the aforesaid little red trunk with writings, and the money,
          and did promise faithfully that he would do accordingly to
           Mr Thornton's desire and mine by the grace of God, but hoped
          I should recover again of that child and perform it myself.
         
           (Which little red trunk he took of my daughter, Alice,
           which I had locked and kept the key, and this canvas bag with that £70.
            
           I sent them up into his chamber by my daughter to him, who
           locked them both in his own trunk to keep for me accordingly.)
         
           And did there remain in his custody, upon these terms
           and no otherwise, until it pleased God and gracious Father to give
          me a safe recovery out of my dreadful and dangerous child-bearing and from all the consequence thereof. Whose recovery was
           unexpected in many regards;</span> <span class="event" id="ev105-start">having lost this, my sweet babe,
           by the too much confidence of Mrs Danby to harden it, as she
           said, by casting off its clothes, imprudently caused my sweet
           infant to get a great looseness. And, in a few days, it cost its life
          and left me in a grievous condition to lose so sweet a goodly
           son of my father's name</span> <span class="event" id="ev106-start">(being at that time in a great danger
           of falling into a cancer in my breast, which he had forced by the
           agonies of death, when they came on him while he sucked and
           gnashed his poor gums together in his departing this life</span>).
         
           But yet, I must ever give the Lord, my God, all praise and
           <span class="quote">glory and honour</span> for evermore to spare me a little longer to praise
           his holy name, and to live to serve him in my generations by
           bringing up my children which he, in mercy, had left me to be <span class="quote">in the
          fear of my God in this evil generation</span>.
          Yet since, after this deliverance to me, I received a very
           severe affliction to exercise those graces, which the Lord had given me
          a trial of in the continuance of my life while I was thus tried
           (as before) by the death of my child and the consequence followed it.
          It pleased God to suffer me to fall into another afflictive
          circumstance which I am obliged to rehearse in vindication of my
          wronged innocency. While I was doing my duty in the securing
           my children's livelihood — as related before, about the writings and
          that money — Satan was busy to undermine my comfort and
           repose. The occasion, which he and his instruments took against me
          to raise all those lies and scandals upon a strict inquiry of all the
          abettors in this tragedy, was the placing of that trunk of writings
          and money in Mr Comber's trunk and keeping, which my bitter enemies
           envying, either my life or comfort in this life, raised against me.

    <span class="event" id="ev107-start">
         
           One day, Mr Comber, coming down to prayers and dinner, had by
          chance left in hast the keys of his trunk on the table in his chamber
          where he laid and sat at study. It was confessed by the maid servant
           called Mary Breakes (before she went away at May Day, before) but
           kept in secret amongst them in the house.
          That this woman, going up into Mr Comber's chamber to dress
           it, make the bed (being the housemaid) that she had found his keys
           of his trunk lying on the table when he was gone down to prayers and dinner.
               

         
          This bold woman had the impudence to open his trunk (but on
          what design God knows) and then she saw in it the aforesaid
           little trunk, which she knew to be my mother's and kept in my chamber 
           with the writings (as before) and was mine. And she saw also the bag of
          money with the trunk, judged them both to be mine and that
          I had given them to Mr Comber — with the blackest of all ignominy as to
          me — and most treacherously had made the report to tell her companions
            
          what she had seen in the trunk.
          And from hence did arise that abominable scandals that
          I had robbed my husband of his money, and had given it away to
           this man, with many other odious lies and invented circumstances,
          which horrid report had been fostered in their malicious hearts for above
           a year before, and never discovered to me, by Mrs Danby or any others,
          whereby I might have made the truth public and have confounded
          their wicked lies against my innocency.
          For the business of the marriage of my daughter, Alice, was
           both thought and agreed upon long before I had this child,
           and articles of marriage drawn amongst us, though it was judged
         
          not fit to declare it to any or made known but to only to Mr Thornton
           himself, my brother Denton and Mrs Danby (who was the first motion
           for Mr Comber made of his desire in this point) though for several reasons was to be kept secret yet until an opportunity for it.
          Yet, she knew all the concerns of the estate and could not be ignorant
            
          of these writings and money carried up into Mr Comber's chamber by
           the order of my husband. And, therefore, the more false and treacherous to
          me, to hear me be wronged in this manner and would join with my
          servants in their forgeries, when it was her duty to have vindicated
          my honest dealings and uprightness of my ways, which she knew
           was but to preserve my posterity when I was gone.
         

         
           If there had been the least tincture of those black crimes true, which
           was by malicious conjectures imagined (that I had been unjust to my dear
             husband in anything in the world or by robbing him of those monies
           that woman saw in the trunk) no wonder they should say I had robbed
           him and he was so low in his estate when I destroyed him in this manner.</span>
          But alas, Lord, my God, to thee do I appeal for justice against
          all my persecutors and slanderers that has opened their mouths against
           me. Thou seest my integrity to my husband, to thee and all the
          world: let them not prosper in their wickedness,

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.94&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 94</a>






            

         but <span class="quote">make a way for me to escape</span> their fury and malice,
           and in thy good time make known the truth to thy glory and my
          comfort. Bring my soul out of these troubles as thou didst
           to thy handmaid and servant, Susannah,
           and that <span class="quote">for Jesus
         
             Christ, his sake</span>, our only Lord and saviour. Amen.

          But, alas, how great a mischief was this unjust calumny
          cast upon my wronged soul, which grieved my dear friends to
           hear and my enemies to rejoice against me, and how small an occasion Satan and his malice can make use of to blaspheme the living
         
           God and traduce his servants: in making a thing innocent in itself to
          appear guilty of crime by a false imagination.
         
    <span class="event" id="ev108-start">
         
           And when the story was told to him — with all the bitter aggravation
            
           imaginable, hoping thereby to have instigated him against
           me that they might make their own ends of him —
          that there was my trunk found in Mr Comber's with a great deal
           of money, a bag of canvas found in his trunk, my dearest
             husband cried out, 'Oh, my poor wife!' How base a wickedness was 
           this against her, and how innocent is she to be charged with wronging of him ; for he knew of that trunk and money which was her
             mother's and advised me to put it into Mr Comber's custody
          to keep for myself and children when I was going to be delivered of my last child, Christopher. Thus, by the good providence of my gracious Father, the truth was made known to
           my husband's and friends' great satisfaction and shame to my enemies.</span>
         
          Yet it was the great misfortune of my life — when my unspotted

         
          reputation laid at the stake and mercy of every malicious
           tongue where I could not have opportunity to be soon cleared —
          to make that appear a crime of the highest nature which was acted
          with so great a piety and prudence and affection of my dear
            husband and myself for the preservation of my children.
          And though hell and his instruments made the worst use that treachery
           could wrest of it, yet that God, who is so gracious and the God of 
          truth, did in mercy and pity to me did make their own lies and
          slanders to be confuted out of their own mouths and make them
           repent many of them. I bless his holy name forever.
         
         
           And that very money which Mr Comber had in keeping for me,
           for which I was so abused, did Mr Thornton know that I laid it out for
           his use and occasions; though it was my dear mother's, he had it all
           freely — so far was I from purloining or robbing of him and taking
           his estate or money from him to anybody's use
         
           that I can make it appear, upon account with him, that
           I had disbursed for his house building and keeping, and many
           other occasions, of my dear mother's money and estate above the
           sum of £500 for his debts and children's maintenance, et cetera.
         

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.95&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 95</a>






         
           Nor did I maintain and subsist and uphold the family of the
             Danbys (my dear sister's children)  for 20 years together out
           of my husband's estate,  as he did very well know, but what I had
          of my dear mother's estate which she bought and gave me to live on
          that was purchased by her widow's estate at Middleham.
          (Paying above £600, the yearly rent, maintained myself and
           assisted me to do what I did for the Danbys and other friends in charity,
           besides my constant layings out for my dear husband's occasions.)
         
           Therefore, I may defy the wickedness of all my cursed enemies
          to tax me with the wronging or injury done to Mr Thornton or his
           estate, or out of it to these ends; doing it out of my own, which
           had given me from God's providence and my dear parents' prudence
          and charity for good ends.
         
          I, indeed, confess I did not lay it out upon any foolish or
           wicked ways, pride of apparel or otherwise evil or wasteful vanity,
          but deemed it my Christian duty to lay little on myself but more
          upon those needful occasions which I thought to relieve others withal
           that stood in need (<span class="quote">let him that hath two coats impart one to him that
          hath none</span>); accounting it also my duty to endeavour to support and
           preserve Mr Thornton and my children with all my fortune by my honoured
            
             father and mother left me.
         
           Therefore, am I bound in conscience to clear my innocency and
          integrity from all such calumnies as my enemies has cast upon
           me, and with holy Job — in the like case when they wronged him — <span class="quote">say
           while I live will I not part with my integrity nor can I justify you</span>.
          And blessed be the great and mighty God, <span class="quote">which sees not as man sees</span>,
           who did deliver his servant, Job, and has in gracious measure done for me,
           his poor, weak and afflicted handmaid. Glory be to his holy name. Amen.
         
           I hope in these things all Christian people will not judge of my
           actions and deportment to be as my enemies would wrong me — and their own
           souls — in believing a lie which none could be counted to be under such abuses,
           but to do (as good Christians) as they would be done unto: <span class="quote">to</span> judge charitably
          and pity my case to be thus traduced by hell and his engines.
          And let me receive the benefit of their prayers to secure my innocency
          and preserve my <span class="quote">good name</span> to posterity to be my comfort and stay under
          all my tribulation; <span class="quote">to have my faith tried</span> to make it pure in God's
           sight but not to be overthrown, that <span class="quote">though Satan may sift me, as he
           did to Peter, yet I may have my faith fixed upon the rock, Christ Jesus,
           who prayed for Peter that his faith may not fail</span>. Even so, Lord Jesus,
          let it be to me thy poor creature that thou mayest have the glory of
           all thy works of mercy and love to mankind.
          Oh, let me not be destroyed but keep me from the malice of their
           tongues to their own confusion that will not repent. But if it be thy will, give
           them grace to repent that thou might convert them, as thou didst to Barbara
           on her deathbed and others, and Charles who asked me forgiveness and Nan Milbank

           (with Hannah and others) who did repent they had heard me to be
           wronged but believed not anything of evil of me — having never seen
           it — but lamented they did not discover such lies to me whereby
          I might have had them punished for their sins and the truth to
           have been sooner appear to my being righted. For this, they begged
          pardon of me on their knees, which I prayed God to forgive them
           and to deliver me out of all such wickedness. Glory be to God for the
          grace thou hast given to these enemies and make them to repent of the
          evil done to me thy poor handmaid. Amen.

           This being the last great trial to my faith and patience — 
          together with my late dreadful sickness and flood upon the great
           grief upon me following my slanders, before the loss and death
           of my ever dear husband — it was but requisite should leave this
          point cleared by the testimony of a good conscience to God and
           the world to the satisfaction of my posterity,
           and also to confirm my truth of my innocency, and the great
          zeal and confidence of my dear husband to be my great and 
           sole comfort to me in that distress (which is so great a joy to me
          that I can never think of it or call these sad things to mind
           without tears, both of joy and sorrow).
         
           Joy to me, to be so greatly in his true and faithful affection
          towards me and pity of me, that I should be so innocent of giving
          cause to my enemies to raise such horrid conjectures of my just
          actions to give no man occasion of suspicion or offence.
         
          
           And cause of very great sorrow <span class="event" id="ev109-start">that he should be so deeply
          concerned for my injuries and wrongs by that slanderous
           tongue, of Mr Tancred of Arden (who had laid a wager with
           my dear Lady Yorke of £100 that if my husband were dead,
          I would be married within a month to Mr Comber) which lie did
          so concern my dear husband that he told my aunt
          Norton he would be revenged of that traitor for traducing so
          much his chaste and innocent wife with such a false lie;
           for he knew that we designed it a match with his
           daughter, Alice, if it pleased God she lived.
         
           But my sorrows was augmented that the vindication
          of my honour should be the occasion of my most dear and 
          loving husband to put himself upon so dangerous and
           hazardous an action, which might hazard his loss of health,
          precious life and that upon my account, but to have put my

          cause solely upon the God of justice to have vindicated
         
          my cause in his good time against all such aspersions which was
           causelessly invented against me. But, alas, I knew not of the
          least of this intention of my dearest joy until afterwards
           (he, having strictly charged my aunt not to discover to me
           until after he was gone).</span>
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev110-start">
         
           But the time of that fair at Malton was come and my
          dear heart would needs go thither, pretending to me some
          earnest business to speak with some about some money owed
           him. And I, seeing a fit of his palsy drawing on, was extremely
          against his going at that time until I had used the method that
           Dr Wittie had ordered me (and with which I had, by God's blessing, often
           cured him, taking it at the first beginning to come on him).
         
           But for all my earnest entreating of him and begging of him,
           for God's sake, not to go to hazard himself until he had used his
           order by clyster
            and other things he had done to cure him withal,
         
           which would prevent the fit 'ere it came.
         
          
           I also begged my brother Denton to persuade with him to stay
          and entreated my aunt to use her best endeavours to work
           with him but to stay one day until he had taken the doctor's order.
           And I used, with all the utmost reason I could, to prevail with him.
           Telling him, my dear heart, if you should take a fit by the way
           and fall ill, it would danger his life before he got to Malton.
         
           My own self, so weak then that I could not hope to recover and I did believe I might not live to see him again, and
          would he go and leave me in that condition? And if the Lord should
          call for us both and leave our dear children so young what will
           become of them, with many other sad arguments to persuade.

          
           But he would not hear any of them, saying I loved him
           too much, and bid me set my love only upon God, for should not
           love any creature so as I did him, for doted too much on him
           and God would take him from me; therefore, prayed me to part
          with him freely to my God, for he would call for whom he
          would and I might live to be more useful to his children
          then he could be.
         
           Then he begged that God would please to take both
           himself and me and all our dear children to himself,
          which petition I gave full consent to be freed out of this 
          miserable wicked world if it was his good pleasure.

         But we must not appoint to his majesty what to do with us,
          but leave our times to his divine pleasure for his glory and our
           eternal happiness, still pressing him but to stay until he
           had taken his preventive physic.
          
          
           My dear still answered me, he would take them at
          Malton and his brother Portington knew all that Dr
            Wittie had directed and had all things convenient, and still
           prayed me to part with him freely, which request God knows,
          I could not grant when his going was like a dagger to my

         
           heart. But he, having set his heart and mind, was so
           resolved by God's grace he would go, and then I fell into a
            deluge of tears when he said to me: 'The Lord be with thee, my
           joy and dear, and send us a happy meeting if not here
           on earth but in heaven'.
         
           Thus, did my dear husband take his last farewell of me , and left me drowned in my sorrow  and tears,
           leaving a sorrowful widow behind him.
          
          
    
         
          
           But he told my dear aunt Norton, who had heard
           of my wrongs and abuses, had come to comfort me in my distress
          and I had entreated her to beg of my dear husband to stay and
          comfort me, and would he leave me in this condition liker to die
           then live? 'No, dear aunt, do not persuade me to stay, for
           it is for my dear wife's sake that I go.
          
           For, by God's grace, I am resolved to go to Malton and I
          will be revenged of that wicked man Tancred, who
           hates me and my family and hath persecuted my loyal,
          innocent wife and brought her to her death by his wicked
            tongue, amongst others for aught I know'.
         
          
           He had done justice upon Mrs Danby and her maid and
           had turned them out of his house for their slanders, and will
            be revenged of them all and punish them. For he took himself
           abused and affronted and wronged in me and, therefore, would not
          put it up nor would he be hindered of this journey.
           But charged her, therefore, not to tell me of what he said
          
         
           however, not until he was gone for grieving me too much.
          How can I sufficiently mourn and lament the loss of this
           dear and faithful affection all the days of my life, and ever
           to honour his memory; continuing his faithful, true and
          loyal spouse; dear and tender over his children, and
           a faithful guardian to them; and preserver of that poor estate
           he left behind him which, I beseech God, grant me the grace
           and opportunity to testify to the end of my days. Amen.

           As to the passages in relating to his journey to Malton,
           having his two careful servants with him — and all things
           I could devise to comfort and assist him thither — and attend him
          there with the methods used for his recovery and the diligent care
          of my brother and sister Portington.</span>
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev112a-start">
          With all the circumstances of his sickness, of his profession of
          faith, his trouble of conscience for sin, his hopes and assurance
          of salvation and all other Christian graces he made himself known
            
          to Mr Sinclair, and his pious end he made at Malton</span>
            <span class="event" id="evn12-start"> 
            (notwithstanding all possible endeavours to save his dear life).

          
           Yet, that first opportunity being lost at his beginning as I said,
           the palsy prevailed and got into his head and other sad troubles,
           as the convulsions, God knows prevailed and</span> <span class="event" id="ev113-start">God would please
           to call him to himself. On September 17th, 1668, he delivered his
           sweet soul into the hand of his heavenly Father.</span>
          
         
           And thus, was he heard as to his own desire to be in heaven:
           'Lord Jesus, prepare me by faith and a holy life to meet the
           <span class="quote">sweet bridegroom of my soul</span>, to praise the Lord, our God,
           for evermore after I have fulfilled that time of afflictions
           and trials, and done that duty which he has appointed me to do. Amen'.

         
           <span class="event" id="ev114-start">The full relation of all these things and of his interment
           in his own quire in Stonegrave, with his fathers, and all concerning
               
             this
           tragedy, is related by me in the 'First Book of My Life' and in the
           beginning of my widowed Book;
           </span>
           having such cause to remain the sad remembrances which followed this change to me and
           mine, it will be useful for me to call to mind the several
          changes that befell me, together with many great and signal
          occurrences that befell me and to my poor family.

          O Lord, God of Hosts, suffer me, who am but <span class="quote">dust and ashes</span>,
          to humble myself before thy divine majesty to pour out
            my prayers and humble petitions before thy <span class="quote">dreadful majesty</span>,
            who
               
            is infinite and incomprehensible; thy wisdom inscrutable;
               

         
            <span class="quote">thy ways unsearchable</span>; thy glory inaccessible; thy judgements
          insupportable; thy mercies inconceivable and innumerable to
            the <span class="quote">sons of men</span>;
          thy glorious attributes are mysterious, and too high for
           man's understanding, <span class="quote">fearful in praises and doing wonders</span>.
           O my glorious Lord God, what am I? A poor, unworthy
            creature; yea, worm and no man, here trembling at the bar
            of thy justice, that knows nothing of thee, O everlasting
            being from eternity to eternity, but what thou art pleased
            to declare of thy majesty to our weak understanding
           and this is life eternal: to know thee, the only true God,
          and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. <span class="quote">O holy, blessed and
            glorious Trinity</span>, I humbly beseech thee to teach me to know
            thee, the only true God, as thou hast declared thyself in thy
            holy word from heaven: <span class="quote">God, the Father, creating me and all
            the world</span>; <span class="quote">God, the Son, redeeming me and all mankind</span>;
            and God, <span class="quote">the Holy Ghost, sanctifying me and all the elect
            people of God</span>.
          <span class="quote">Three persons in one holy God</span>, <span class="quote">the Trinity in unity and
           unity in Trinity, is to be worshipped</span>. <span class="quote">O thou, most holy, glorious and
            blessed Trinity, three persons and one God</span>, <span class="quote">have mercy
          upon me, thy poor and unworthy creature</span>. <span class="quote">I know thou
           art a consuming fire</span> and if <span class="quote">Moses, thy servant, did tremble before
           thee</span>, how then dare I — the sinfullest of thy creatures — presume to
           approach before thy <span class="quote">glorious majesty</span>?
           <span class="quote">But oh, alas, whither shall I fly from thee but thou art there:
            if I fly up into heaven, thou art there; if I go down to hell, thou
            art there; if I remain in the sea or land, thou art there by thy power
            and providence. Oh, where shall I go then from thy presence</span>?
            Thy omnipresence is in heaven and earth; oh, whither can I go
            to hide myself from that great God who I have desired to serve?
          But <span class="quote">I abhor myself in dust and ashes</span> before thy face 
           and <span class="quote">cry out, 'unclean, unclean', before thee, O Lord</span>.

          Therefore, with Job, <span class="quote">I lay my mouth in the dust</span> and am not able to
          look up in thy presence or lift up my eyes to heaven by reason
            of sin, being most miserably blind to keep thy holy laws;
            whereby, if a man do them, even he shall be happy and live in them.
           <span class="quote">But if thou, O Lord, beest
            extreme to mark what is amiss,
            O Lord, who may abide it</span>? <span class="quote">There is mercy with thee and therefore
            art thou feared</span>. Oh, <span class="quote">enter not into judgement with thy servant,
            for in thy sight shall no man living be justified</span>. <span class="quote">If we say we
            have no sin, we deceive ourselves but, if we confess and forsake our
            sins, thou art faithful to forgive us our sins and the blood of
            our Lord Jesus cleanseth us from all sins</span>.
           And only in the merits and sufferings of our Lord and saviour, Jesus
            Christ, must we be saved; who, for the sins of the world, he suffered
          death upon the cross to make satisfaction to his heavenly Father
          for our sins and to reconcile us to God: he suffered for sin that
            sinned not that those that believed should be saved.
           <span class="quote">Lord, I believe,
               
             help my unbelief</span>. Whither should I go but unto thee, the inexhaustible fountain of goodness?
            I acknowledge mine offences and my sins are ever before me. <span class="quote">Oh, hide
            thy face away from my sins and cleanse me from all my iniquities</span>.
            <span class="quote">I am of unclean lips</span>; how then can I speak to thee, the living
          God?
           <span class="quote">I will lay my hand on my mouth and my mouth in the dust</span>.
          I have heard of thee by the ear but now I see thy glory in all thy
            dealings with me but, O Lord, destroy me not; for I am thy creature,
            made to adore and serve thee, the eternal Lord God of Glory.
           But alas, I have sinned and offended that great God that gave
            me breath, and broken all thy holy precepts in <span class="quote">thought, word and deed</span>
          many
               
            times with a high hand and full consent. Woe be unto me, a <span class="quote">miserable sinner</span>, but I repent and mourn and grieve for all my sins that I
            have done ever since I was born. <span class="quote">Enter not into judgement with me</span>, O Lord,
            lest I be consumed and brought to nothing. <span class="quote">Have mercy on me and do
            away my offences</span>; <span class="quote">purge me and wash me, and make me clean</span>, take away
          my offences and thou shalt find none.
           Oh, let me be an example of thy mercy and not of thy judgement. 
            <span class="quote">Thou gainest glory by those sinners that repentest</span>; oh, let me be one
            of them that I might have glory by my conversion and not confusion.
           Though thou hast proved me with many and great afflictions, yet hast thou
            not brought me to confusion nor destroyed me out of the <span class="quote">land of
            the living</span>. Therefore, will I glorify thy holy name forever, who hath
            given me time and space to repent. <span class="quote">Oh, give me also grace to repent
            and perfect that good work which thou hast begun in me, O Lord</span>.
           I know, of very faithfulness, thou hast caused me to be troubled <span class="quote">that
            I may not be condemned with the wicked who thou hast forsaken</span>. <span class="quote">Oh, praise
            the Lord, O my soul</span>, <span class="quote">give thanks unto his holy name</span>.

          Oh, sanctify all thy dealings and dispensations towards me, I humbly
            beseech thee, O Lord, to thy poor handmaid and servant who thou
          hast taken away those comforts enjoyed: my dear husband, my
            comfort and earthly joy. Oh, make me solely to depend on thyself for
          my everlasting comfort that will never fail.
           <span class="quote">When my father and mother forsaketh me, the Lord taketh me
            up</span>. Let me not depend upon any of the transitory comforts of
            this life (whom I have too much doted upon and have not looked up
            to thee as I ought and to have my heart so fixed on heaven) <span class="quote">troubled
          with Martha's cares and not so much of Mary's choice to mind that one
            thing necessary</span>.
           Oh, let me now, I beseech thee, O Lord, never be so much
            tormented with the first but, as much as it is possibly, to mind the second
            that shall never be taken from me, though thou hast suffered the evil
          world to take away from me most of that riches and good fortune
            thou pleases to give me, and to trample my <span class="quote">good name</span> under foot which
          thou had graciously given thy servant.
           Yet thou, in great mercy, has yet reserved me a competency
            of the one and a support under the other calamity. Oh, take not away
            thy Holy Spirit from me, nor take not thy mercy utterly from me
          but let me so repent, believe and reform whatever is amiss in me
          <span class="quote">that I may not be cast away out of the sight of thy eyes of pity
            and compassion</span>. Though thou hast made me <span class="quote">a desolate widow</span>, yet,
            O Lord, thou art my God and <span class="quote">Father of mercies</span>; yea, to all that are
          oppressed with wrong. <span class="quote">I am now a fatherless, friendless, afflicted widow</span>, has none to help in my worldly affairs. I am weak, sick
           and oppressed, and my sins has deserved these punishments but, O Lord,
           I look to thee, my <span class="quote">Father of heaven</span>, for relief and comfort in this
           distress of soul and body. Oh, <span class="quote">leave me not</span> comfortless forever.
          But grant me thy grace, wisdom and support to carry me
           through this <span class="quote">vale of tears</span> and wilderness of troubles: be my God,
          my guide, my support and deliverer by the directions of thy Holy
           Spirit; <span class="quote">leave me not</span> to be trodden down by hell <span class="quote">or Satan, or any
             of his instruments, that seeks to devour me</span>.
           O thou, great king and God of all the earth, who desireth
            not the death of the wicked but hast sworn by thy own self, as
            in thy holy prophets, saying: <span class="quote">as I live, saith the Lord, I desire not the
          death of a sinner but rather that he may turn from his
            wickedness and live, calling to the children of Israel: why will
              yea die, O house of Israel</span>? But, O my God, <span class="quote">it is not in man to
                 turn his own heart or repent except thou dost first give
            him grace to repent</span>.
           Alas, O Lord, my God, since thou hast made thyself to
            beknown to me, thy servant, and hast made, created, supported
            and delivered ever since I was born, done wonders and miracles that none
            could have done for me, but by thy everlasting power from
           above has killed and made me alive again;

         <span class="event" id="ev115-start">
         has put thy fear into my heart ever since I was four years old in
            thy holy word (Psalm 147:4: <span class="evquote"/>He counteth the stars and calleth them
          all by their names),
           </span>
           so is thy power also able to enumerate all
          my sins, but who can plead for me, who stand at the bar
            of thy justice? <span class="quote">But if thou, O Lord, should be extreme to mark
            what is done amiss, O Lord, who may abide it</span>?
          I appeal from the bar of thy justice to the throne of thy
           mercy and plead for thy son's sake, <span class="quote">Christ Jesus, the righteous</span>,
          that thou wilt pardon and forgive those sins which hast been
           done against thy majesty and <span class="quote">give me a true repentance,

           what is good, that by a holy change of mind in <span class="quote">thought, word

          power and dominion of sin that remaineth
               
           in this mortal, <span class="quote">I may
          become the servant of the living God</span> in all my life and conversation. 
           And to that end, I humbly beseech thee, O Lord, make
            thy word to me good as thy servant, David, speaks in the third verse of this
          psalm: <span class="quote">He healeth those that are broken in heart and giveth
            medicine to heal their sickness</span>. Oh, therefore, I pray thee, O my God,
            
            as thou hast broken my heart with all thy judgements, trials and
            afflictions for my sins and sorrows for them, show my medicines
            to heal all my sicknesses; for thou art the <span class="quote">physician of our souls</span>,
          speak the word and thy servant shall be healed from all my sins
            and afflictions, sicknesses, crosses and sorrows.
           O dear Lord God of all the earth, <span class="quote">to thee shall all nations come
          for thou hast healings and pardon to believing and returning sinners 
            under thy wings</span>. <span class="quote">Heal my soul</span> from those wounds that sin hath made,

        How can I begin my sorrowful history of my life in this
          condition of a widow, since I enjoyed so little comfort
           in the married estate (without tears) but, with the prophet
           Jeremiah wish, <span class="quote">oh, that my eyes were a fountain of tears
          that I might weep day and night for our sins</span>, which has
          caused the Lord to exercise his judgements upon this our

           he not made a full end of me and my children

           obedient servants, to enjoy that good inheritance which thou,
           in abundant mercy, hath prolonged so many hundreds of
          years in the name and blood of my dear husband and his
           forefathers, and that I may live, by thy good providence, to see thy

           The sudden surprising of the loss of my dearest earthly
             comfort being taken from me — when he, alas, would needs go
          to Malton, as I have related in this Book — finding me in so
          great a disturbance of grief and sorrows for that unmerited
          and abominable slanders was enough to have broken the
           heart of any poor, weak creature (almost spent) before this
           saddest blow came upon me of being deprived of my dear husband.</span>
          
         
           But what could I do better than to entertain this
           bitter case than, with holy Job, <span class="quote">the Lord gives,  and the Lord takes
           away from me. Blessed be the name of the Lord</span>.
          The Lord had lent me this excellent blessing of a good husband
           and now he hath taken him to himself. Oh, that I might
          glorify thy holy name for all thy gracious dispensations
           both in his life, his often sickness, his deliverances, his health,
           his trials and suffering; his gracious spirit, wherewith thou did
          induce him to walk uprightly before thee, and for thy last and
          great mercy in giving him true faith to apprehend thy being
          reconciled to him. And that thou didst receive his soul into
          thy gracious mercy and so freed him from this <span class="quote">body of sin and
            death</span> to live with thee forever. Glory be to the great God of
          all the earth for thy infinite mercies to him and me
           forever. Oh, let me so live here a few days that I may not be ashamed to live or afraid to die <span class="quote">for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen</span>.
         
           Oh, was it not the inexpressible tender mercies of my Lord
          God which had compassion on me that I did not perish by griefs,
           sorrows, floods but, in the midst of judgement, remembered
           mercies, and brought me deliverances. <span class="quote">Praise the Lord, O my soul</span>,
           praise his holy name which did not suffer thy soul to perish, <span class="quote">nor
             thy faith to fail</span>, nor let me fall into the hand of Satan to make
           me despair, or distracted, or murdered my soul with sinning.
         
           O Lord, let me never forget thy pity and compassion to me,
           the <span class="quote">handmaid of the Lord</span>, to keep me from sinking under thy
           heavy hand of corrections, but preserved me <span class="quote">by thy providence</span> and
           supported me with thy grace and Holy Spirit. <span class="quote">Oh, what shall I render

           Oh, where shall I begin to speak of the goodness of the Lord to me
           in this condition? For his providence, foreseeing which trial he would
           please to bring upon me, had provided great share of comforts for
           me to assist my spirit, to succour me in this distress, as of some of
           my dear friends who came to see me, out of their faithful and
           Christian love, to comfort me almost swallowed up by sorrows.
         
           My dear aunt Norton and Dr Samways and Daphne, who 
          was extreme kind and charitable to me in the transactions of my
          temporal affairs and worldly concerns, which came upon me like a
           torrent to fall upon my head and heart, how to bring myself
          and children out of those labyrinths in which I was plunged.
           In the midst of all my troubles, I found it my only help
            to look up to heaven for his divine assistance that, as his good
            pleasure was to call me to this dispensation of a widow, so he
            would vouchsafe to do to me as he did to the <span class="quote">widow of Zarephath</span>:
               

            
          not to suffer the oil in the cruse or barrel of meal to fail until
          I shall have paid all my husband's debts and had sufficient to
            bring up my dear children in the fear and nurture of thee, my
            gracious God and heavenly Father, <span class="quote">to whom be all glory, power,
            dominion and praise henceforth for evermore</span>. Amen.

         
           <span class="event" id="evn13-start">
           I have related the manner how my dear husband visited
           in his last sickness; his journey to Malton, where he died;</span> <span class="event" id="ev117-start">his being
           brought to Newton on September the 18th; departing this life on September
             17, 1668; his coming to me home, his last journey with his body,
          to Newton in Madam Palmes her coach.


         
           The manner of his interment with all imaginable solemnity and decency, as much and more than my estate would permit,
           which my tender and endeared love could show itself both for
           the honour of the family and the worthiness of his person, with all the good
          circumstances
               
             I was capable to do for the head of this ancient and
           good family. And, I hope, to the satisfaction of all his dear and near
          relations who could not be ignorant of the condition I was left
           in by the infinite debts and the education of his children to lie most
          upon my shoulders. God grant me strength to be supported under
          the pressure of these things. The charges of the funeral and 
           all which I disbursed upon this sad occasion, with mournings for
           
             
             
             my
             
            
             three brothers and two brothers-in-law, with his two sisters,


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.116&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 116</a>






            
           


            came to the sum of
           ,
           besides what was given in charity on that occasion. And as for
           the wages due to all his servants and all other debts, which
          I have paid for my dear husband of what nature or kind
           soever that I could collect, due from him on any account after
           his death — though I never knew of them, or heard what they were,
           before his death — if any could make them out of the justice or
           right to be due, either to his brothers and sisters or others.</span>
          
         
           I bless God, he gave me a heart and conscience to discharge
          the same over and beside the appraisement of his personal
           estate (which was but very little, if that my goods which I had
          bought with my dear mother's money, which ought to have been by
          her will given to myself and children according to her deed
           and will).
          
    <span class="event" id="ev120-start">
         
           After the solemnity of my dear husband's
          funeral was over, the first and great concern to be done
           was to have the choice of an administrator, to have a good
           and honest person got to do justly in that weighty concern.
         
         
         
           They told me that it, by law, did fall on myself
          as his widow to take administration of my husband's
           goods and to pay debts, et cetera, by reason there was no will made.

        
         
           As to the making of his will, I had very often put him
          in mind of it when I saw he did so frequently fall into
           those palsy fits, desiring he would please to do it for the
          satisfaction of all the world and that he would please to order
           his debts to be paid as he would have them done.
         
           All the answer my dear husband was pleased to give
           me was, he had settled his estate at Leysthorpe as he would have
           it to pay debts and for his children, and he desired me to see
           his debts paid as he knew I had a good conscience to do.
         
           I told him, again, 'My dear heart, you know there is
           nothing to maintain my dear son, Robert, but out of my
           jointure and estate and, if you leave anything to pay, the
           debts withal'. I was not unwilling to do it but, if they were so
           many and so great, I doubted I could not do it and to
          educate my poor child withal.
         
           So, Mr Thornton did not make any will but what he 
          had said of Leysthorpe for debts.
          

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.117&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 117</a>






          
    
         
           But, after his decease, it was necessary that one should
           take administration to the personal estate, and to order and
          pay all things according to law and to have an appraisement
           of the goods, as the law appoints in that case.
         
           So, my brother Denton told me that it was belonging
           to me for to do it and that, if I did not take administration
           myself, I might choose one to take that office upon him.
         
           I told my brother then that it may be that it did
           of right belong to me, as the sorrowful widow of my dear
             husband and, if I were in a condition or capacity to do it,
          I would very willingly performed that office for my dear
            husband and pay all things that was due to everyone (as my own
           conscience tells me to do right to all, if it were in my power,
           for the dear and tender affection I have for him and his memory).
         
           But, alas, it had pleased God to visit me with very
           heavy and great afflictions, both on my spirit and weakness of
          my body, so that I did not expect to outlive my dear
            husband long and, besides, I was of so weak capacity and
          knowledge in such things that I did not know how to order
          and manage so great a concern as I ought to do.
         
           And besides, I had my son, Robert, to take care of and to bring
           up and educate, with his two sisters, and the three children now
          was my nearest concern, since the Lord had taken away my
            husband. And I determined, God willing, to take the tuition
          of them and to take the best care I could to bring them up in
          the fear of God and educate them the best to my power, if that
          God pleased to bless me and spare my life and health.
         
           After this discourse to my brother Denton, he told me that
           some care must be taken of the estate too, and it was well done in me
          to be concerned for my children's education which was indeed the
           great concern of the family. And if I pleased, because I was
           so weak and could not perform both, to nominate a person who
          might be proper for to take that trust upon him and to act in
          the business of the estate.
         
           Upon this, I told my brother Denton that there was none
            more fit or proper to undertake so great a trust


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.118&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 118</a>






            
           

           and act in that concern as himself, who was so wise and
          prudent, and knowing a person in all such affairs and the
          law to act accordingly. Nor no man knew the concerns
           of Mr Thornton's estate and himself and family,
          being so kind and good a friend to my dear husband
          and do all things according to equity and justice.
         
           If he would please to undertake that trouble, the
           family would be much obliged to him for it and I, in particular, account myself much engaged for his favour.
         
           But my brother Denton made an excuse and
           said he would serve the family in anything he could, 
           but he could not do that: he was a trustee for the children
           and could not be both (though he was a trustee for the debts too
           as well in that deed of Leysthorpe as well as for the children).
         
           Then, I said, if my brother Portington would do
           as much as take that trust of administrator on him,
           I should desire he would please to do it for Mr Thornton.
          But Mr Denton made the same return for him as
           he had done for himself. So, he left me in a great concern
           how or where to pitch of a right and good man to do it.
         
           At last, he said that if one could be thought upon
           which had not much estate, but an honest man and one of
          an indifferent judgement that would be advised how to
          manage the concerns of the estate, it were better to have such
           an one than have any of a good estate, or were too wise and
          would not be advised.
         
           So, when several was named did not please in one
          point or other, at last I desired him to nominate one,
           who, after a little pause, named Mr Thornton's servant
          who he had caused the warren house to be builded for
           him to live in (having married Nan Robinson what so abused
          me about a great lie she told my brother Thomas of myself and maid, Jane Flower, and had made my brother ever
           since my bitter enemy against me).
         
           And to please Mr Thornton, I had granted that the warren
          house should be builded for them to live in, but this people
          was my great adversaries ever after and a great loss and 
          destruction to the estate of Mr Thornton and myself.
         
           This man could neither write nor read and was but

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.119&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 119</a>






            of indifferent parts or honesty, not at all in my thoughts
           capable or fit for such a matter of importance of the family;
          so that I was forced to decline this motion as modestly
           as I could and speak my thoughts that, in regard he could
           neither read nor write, he could not understand the business
          nor dispatch anything of that nature.
         
           But my brother Denton did incline to none like him and
          did pray me to think of it because if the debts should come
          too fast on he might plead a plene administravit.

         
         
           The unfitness of this man was indeed a great trouble to me,
           being too nimble of his fingers — which I knew and had proof of
           in the house though would not be believed by those proposed him — 
           put me to a great trouble what to do lest their importunity,
           and fearing to displease them, might have him cast upon me.
           So, I would not consent but said I would consider of it.
          
           But behold the gracious goodness and mercy of my God,
           when, in the midst of my distress,
             made a way for me to
          escape the necessity of having such an one to be made a slave
          to. He caused an unexpected providence to fall out, and as
           poor Daphne said, 'God had sent me a friend, after my own 
        [heart]
    '.
           And, just as I was in trouble and pouring out my prayers to heaven
          to assist and direct me to one fit for us in this great affair
            — which concerned indeed the right payment of debts and all things
           else about the administrator — 
         
            Daphne, looking out at the window, heard a horse at the door,
           cried out: 'Oh, mistress, God has heard your prayers and has sent
           you a good and honest man as you desired to help you. And that is
          Mr Anthony Norton which is come to see you only as a visit since
           Mr Thornton's death'.
         
           After this good man came to see me, I asked him if he would
           do me the favour to stand for Mr Thornton's administrator, to bear
           the name, and I would take care that the charges should be no
          way troublesome to him but should be paid for his journeys and for
          his expenses, but that he should be saved harmless of anything
          concerning that business. For I was now extremely weak and sick
           and could not be able to travel about it, nor would any of Mr Thornton's
          friends do it, nor I could not have any stranger to confide in
           like him and hoped that God had, in providence, sent him hither.

           When this good man, my cousin Norton, heard me make my
          request and moan to him, it pleased God to put it into his mind
           and to pity <span class="evquote">my desolate condition</span>: said, 'Dear madam, I am
          truly sorry for your loss of good Mr Thornton and wish that I could
           do anything to serve you and your children, but do not
          understand these things very well.
          
            But shall be willing to do you any kindness for your
           own sake, having a great honour for yourself and family.
           Indeed, I have done it once for my cousin Maulger Norton, but
           he directed me in all things and proceedings, and by his order I acted
           and finished that concern for his son, Edmund, I hope to his
           own satisfaction and all creditors. 
         
            And if you will give me your orders how to act, I shall observe it the best I can or anything else for you lies in my power'.
           When I heard what this good old man said, in a full answer to
          my desire in this business, I blessed and praised my good God
           for his mercy to me in granting my humble petitions, hoping
          this was ordered by his providence for good to me and mine.
         
           I acquainted my brother Denton with this opportunity of my cousin, Anthony Norton, being come and of my gaining
               

            
          his assistance in accepting to be my husband's administrator
               

            
           which, by reason he knew him to be an honest good man and
           his wife's relation and uncle, did approve well of, and so upon
           full agreement about this business proceedings went on. And
           Mr Flathers, being rural dean, came to Newton with orders
          to take my renunciation of the administration and my
           cousin Anthony Norton's name put in, to whom I gave up my
          power in it.
         
           And my cousin Norton took out letters of administration,
           according to law, out of the court and entered bond to the
          court for right administrating as in order of law.</span>
          
         
           After this great matter of the administration was settled, it
            was requisite that I should take the tuition of my
             poor children, being now, by this great change, become
          both father and mother, and guardian to them. A duty
           which I willingly undertook for their own and father's sake, having
           a threefold tie upon me as being my own, dearly bought in
          bringing them forth by exquisite torments and pains in childbearing, added to many cares and difficulties in their bringing
          up to their several ages.
           As to my son, Robert, he was solely left to my charge


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.121&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 121</a>






         for subsistence, since there was not out of the estate at Leysthorpe
            more than what would provide for his two sisters' maintenance
            and portions of  to each, and much less than the value
          I brought to the estate and family, which could not be expected
          by reason of the heavy debts and portions my husband laid
            under to the provision of his sisters and brothers.
           Besides, Mr Thornton having been forced to sell his land
          at Burn Park for debts, which was settled before marriage on his
          younger children when Leysthorpe was then also settled on his
          heir male, but all that did not satisfy for the portions and provision
            for his brothers and sisters (with my £1000 out of Ireland
            to clear all debts as before related in this Book).
          But the moiety of the land was fully charged of Leysthorpe
          at present by a mortgage to Mr Portington and Mr Raines until 
           they were paid the sum of £1600  and all interest due for it.
           For the better security of which mortgage, it was deemed by them and
           Mr Denton that Mr Anthony Norton, as administrator to Mr Thornton,
          should make over that rentcharge of £200  per annum which Sir
            Christopher Wandesford, my brother, had made to Mr Thornton at
           his delivery up the Irish estate to Sir Christopher Wandesford.
          He did then make over a rentcharge of £200  a year for
             until my £1000 portion and the debt of Nettleton
          was satisfied to my husband, which he had been forced to pay by
          reason of his taking the assignment of Maulger Norton on him.
           Out of this Irish rentcharge, Mr Norton gave security to them
          and it was paid to them with interest as it became due and could returned
          by Sir Christopher Wandesford, with deductions for all returns from thence,
          which did take up a great deal of that annuity or rentcharge and
          was a very great loss to me and my estate.
           As for the moiety of Leysthorpe, out of which the children was to
            be educated and have maintenance, all public charges and assessments
            was to be paid and interest for debts out of that part for the children, as it
            was ordered by their father in that deed. So that, for several years
            together, I received not towards my daughter Kate's maintenance
          or for her education the sum of 20 shillings or of 10, though she should have
            had equal with her sister after £40  a year to each of them.
            But I did borrow for her, keeping several years that I wanted out
            of Leysthorpe, and never had it made good to me as I ought out of that land,
            that is still owing to me the sum of

          Where then could there be anything to bring up my only son,
            Robert, but what, by God's providence, I could have out of my
          jointure and my dear mother's estate at Middleham?
         
           All which was so burdened with public charges and debts, which
          I was forced to contract upon several accounts fell on me
          that I had great straits, which I entered on upon my husband's
           death (borrowing even from the first to pay funeral charges,
           and to keep house with and to maintain my children).
         
         
           I entered bond to the court for the tuition of my three children;
           my poor son, Robert, was but six years old when his dear
             father was buried, September 19th, 1668, his first tying cloths
           was mourning for his father.
           My daughter, Alice, her age was, January 3rd,
             16.
            
         
         
           My daughter, Katherine, her age was, June 2nd,
           12.
         
         
          As for my two daughters, there was to have been £40  a year for
            each out of the land of Leysthorpe to maintenance, but such
          was the great taxes, assessments and all public charges after
            Mr Thornton's death, with the payment of interest for debts,
           that it fell much short every half year and some years
            was very little to be had, so that I had great difficulty to live,
          as well to maintain my own family, pay interest for those
            debts (so contracted as to keep my son which I had solely to
            provide for) without borrowing.
         
           Which cannot be imagined but reduced me to great straits,
          entering into this widowed condition at first with debts
           and my estate at Newton which was most of it in Elizabeth
             Hickes's hand. She paid no more for all the park and upper ground
           but £28  a year, which, after she was gone off, I made of that very
          grounds in my own hand by stock and gates near 
          £150
           per annum.
         
           Yet, having undertook this charge upon me, I did my
           best endeavours to discharge a good conscience towards my dear
          children with a tender regard for them both in sickness and in
            health. And I hope none of them can say they wanted anything
            was fit for them in all conditions, and I hope, I may, with a
            good conscience, appeal to my gracious God that I made
          it my duty to serve him in the performance of my paternal
            care over them whom he had put into my hand, with all due
            affection and prudence, and to correct their sins and instructing them
            in all duties of piety and religion.
        

          
    <span class="event" id="ev125-start">
         
            After I had prevailed with my cousin Norton to accept
           of the administration, it was the first in order to have
            
            


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.123&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 123</a>






           the goods appraised, and to that end there was four chosen to be
          appraisers and that two be indifferently chosen. But was wholly in
            the dark where to pitch for two that might not be biased,
           being a stranger to them and all for the other concern. But I did
          not desire more than justice and equity in this action since I
          too well knew who was to bear the burden and the weaker
           horse, and none to be put to their helping hand to ease it or bear part.
           At length, I chose and desired my brother Denton to be
          pleased to be one to stand for me and if he pleased to choose
          whom he would. He named Mr Denton of Nawton and Robert
            Garbutt, then wanted one more; they put me to name one, and
          I named Thomas Thompson.
          A day was appointed to meet at my house at East
          Newton when the goods was brought out in readiness what
           was Mr Thornton's to be appraised.</span>
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev125a-start">
           As for what was my dear mother's goods, I desired
            Daphne (who by the good providence of God was yet with me
            here to assist me in my house and troubles) that she — being with
            my dear mother in her last sickness and death, and at her
          will making and inventory and appraising her goods — I desired her
          she would go along with them and, what she knew was my
            dear mother's in the house,
          that she would tell my brother Denton and the appraisers
          which they were because she only knew them. And I had also acquainted
          my brother with it when he asked me who should go along
           to show them the goods in the house.</span>
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev126-start">
           But, before they went upon the appraisement, my brother
            Denton, out of his regard to me, said that it was the law and usually
            done that the widow was to have her widow's bed first, out of all
            her husband's goods, choose where she would and commonly they chose
            the best where she would, and if I pleased I should have one.
          I thanked him for his advice and telling of it. I knew it was
           my right and due, as I was his sorrowful widow but, in regard
          there was so many and great debts of my dear husband's which
          could not be scarcely paid, I would deny myself of that
           right and privilege and remitted it from myself, wishing
          that his goods would pay all the debts.</span>
           
            <span class="event" id="evn14-start"> 
            And by my dear mother's kindness to me, she had given
          me beds enough for myself and family, or else I should be 
            but in a sad condition. But thanked him for his respect to
           me in that kind offer.

         Besides I had taken advice of Mr Driffield not to administer
          unto the goods, nor undertakes or meddle with them to administer
           in my own wrong (if I had meddled with them and made myself
           liable to pay all the debts) for the debts far exceeded all the
          worth of the goods Mr Thornton had.</span>
          
          But forever blessed and praised be the name of my
           gracious God, who delivered me out of that snare and
          danger of utter ruin at this time and all others of my
           temporal miseries. Oh, be pleased, O my God, still to support
           and succour me, <span class="quote">thy desolate widow</span> and sick handmaid.
          
    <span class="event" id="ev127-start">
         
           After this passage, before the appraisement begun, my good
             brother Denton came to me, in a friendly way, that perhaps
           I did not know as much, but he thought fit to tell me of it,
          that he knew my mother had given me her personal estate
          and goods by her will and testament.
               

         
         
           But, whatever was so given to the wife will fall due to
           Mr Thornton, my husband, and by the law nothing which was so
           given to the wife but did fall due to the husband; for the 
           property was in him and not in the wife (being under covert baron)
           and, therefore, all my lady's goods and personal estate would
          fall due to be appraised amongst the rest of his goods as his was.
         
           Upon which discourse I was much surprised to hear this
          sad news, which it had been all along harped after as by Harry
          Best betraying me to that which they would have had by his false
           deed. But I bless God, I was aware of it and did not sign it,
           but now the bottom was laid open; it being all along a
          design
             to have had the property of her estate to have paid his
           debts, which was my blessed mother's intention to secure for myself and children which she foresaw would be left poor enough.
         
           But after some pause,
               
             I gave him thanks for his 
          kindness in acquainting me with the matter of law in this thing
          and particular and withal though my mother has given her estate
           and goods to myself and children as I see cause, yet
           rather than just debts should not be paid, I would quit
          my right in them. If I must not have them according to her
          deeds and last will and testament, I must borrow a bed for
           myself until I could buy one (this being a surprisal
           to me, at that time, to have her will so broken).
         
           'But, Sir, I must now let you know the reason why my
             dear mother did settle her estate personal in that manner';
          she has done to prevent what she otherwise see might come to
           pass, as it is God knows, come to pass too true.

           <span class="event" id="ev128-start">
           That my dear mother, having advised Mr Thornton against
          taking upon him the assignment of Maulger Norton as very
           pernicious for him and his estate (such troubles in the
            
             managery
           of such a concern was contrary to his humour or practice) and well
          knowing that the deeds and last will and testament did sufficiently
           secure both his interest and her own.
          
           But that Mr Thornton would not take her advice
           not to meddle with Maulger Norton's assignment —
          but by acting in that business contrary to reason and her judgement
           and interest in the Irish estate and his own,</span> <span class="event" id="ev129-start">and foreseeing what
            ill consequence it would be of —  
          
          
          
            she did then resolve, by the best counsel she got, what
          way she had best to take by law for the securing all her personal
          as well as real estate that she might preserve and secure it for
           myself and children. For she said, Mr Thornton, by acting in
           that affair which did not belong unto him, would certainly
           involve himself and estate into debts and suits with Sir Christopher Wandesford
            (who expected that estate as heir) and charge his own estate with them,
           though there was ten times more of my father's then would pay all
           he owed, and all gifts, portions and legacies.
         
           This made her foresee a great deal of trouble and encumbrances
           to fall upon Mr Thornton by those transactions, even to the endangering his own estate by engagements. She told me often,
           why should I want a bed to lay my bones in and my children,
          which she feared on the former account would be taken from us
           by debts (which needed not having brought so fair a fortune).
          
           Upon these considerations, she had, by advice of an able
           lawyer, made a deed of gift to feoffees
           in trust of all her
           estate, personal whatever — which schedules
             annexed of her goods to such
           purposes and intentions use and dispositions as therein mentioned — 
         
            for to secure it to myself during life and, at my death, to such
          child or children as I should see best deserving.
          Still the property to be kept in those feoffees in trust and not to be made
           liable to any other use, as debts and other inconveniences, as consequence to the assignment.</span>
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev130-start">
         
           Moreover, she said his taking it upon him had lost her the
          sum of £1500  of her arrears of her annuity in Ireland that Sir
            John Lowther would have given her — and offered it to her in my 
           hearing — if she would quit her arrears for £300  per annum for 19 years
          after my father's death to his son Sir Christopher Wandesford.
           But my uncle, Richard Darley, would not let my mother
           take the £1500  Sir John Lowther bid her, because of the design of the
          assignment of Maulger Norton, and my mother got not one penny

         of all that great right to her. Nor Mr Thornton neither but
           was quite lost from us by this unfortunate assignment, and my

            
           estate near ruin until long after; in 1664, the estate was
          delivered up to Sir Christopher Wandesford on the securing that rentcharge of £200
           per annum to pay off Nettleton's debt (£1000)  and to pay
          my £1000
             part of my portion out of Ireland.

    <span class="event" id="ev131-start">
         
           So, after this discourse, I desired to show my brother Denton
          all my dear mother's writings and deeds which settled that
           point, with the deed of gift and her last will and testament.
           He, having read them, was much surprised and said that he had
           never seen them before. (But I thought I had showed them to him
          when Harry Best drew the deed for me to sign but I told him of
           them how my dear mother had settled them.)
         
           And then, he said that my lady's goods could not be
           touched and that he had never seen anything better done in his life,
           and that the property was not in Mr Thornton, nor could they
           be made liable to Mr Thornton's debts or disposal (the property
           not being in him but the trustees). Which, when I heard him
          say so, I had the more cause to bless God for, which had in 
           mercy so provided for me — by my dear mother's blessing and
           prudence — to preserve something for my necessities for myself and poor children now, in my sad and <span class="evquote">desolate condition</span>.</span>
          
         
           But I will praise and bless and magnify the name of the
          Lord God of Hosts for his inexpressible bounty and mercy and 
           pity towards me, his weak servant and handmaid, who, in
           his good providence, had put it into my dear and excellent mother's
          heart thus to provide and preserve these few things in comparison
          to all her great estate she had been wronged of. The Lord make me
           <span class="quote">truly thankful</span> for this particular mercy to me and my orphans.

            
           O Lord, I pray thee still to help and assist thy servant out of all
           evil designs that are against me, thy poor widow, and make me have a
           supply of all things needful for soul and body <span class="quote">for Jesus Christ, 
           his sake</span>. Amen.
          
    <span class="event" id="ev132-start">
         
         And thus, by God's gracious providence to me and my 
             poor children, I was preserved and these goods (which was of my dear
               mother's, being expressed in her inventory) saved from being
           sold to pay those debts which I no way contracted, and these
          only was enjoyed by the virtue of my mother's wise disposal
            to succour me. Or else I might have been left, and my children
            to have bought — as I was forced to do — without that I had
           bought those of the great parlour and scarlet chamber; though I bought
           them with my dear mother's money, yet I could not have them
          without buying them. How far was this of my having a
          widow's bed allowed me out of all Mr Thornton's goods?

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.127&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 127</a>






          For when the goods was to be appraised, which was in the scarlet
            chamber, came to be looked upon by the appraisers, I told them
            that  I bought them with my mother's money and ought not
            to be appraised and pleaded they were all hers, bought by me and
            paid for of her money. It was quickly answered me that
            her money being converted into goods, and they not expressed
            in her will and deed of gift, did fall to Mr Thornton's part
          and so must be appraised as his.
         
           Which goods I so bought and paid for, came to the sum
            
         
          But if I had had any relation or friend with me that would
           have stood up for the widow's right, either law or equity
           things must not have gone so, but I, alas, had no uninterested
          person to assist me in all these occasions and I was left desolate
           </span>
          only from what heaven was pleased to give me his helping
           hand, for which I return his holy name praises forever.
          
    <span class="event" id="ev132a-start">
           Therefore, I esteem the mercy of God was very great to me
            that poor Daphne was here with me, at this present, when the
          appraisement was made because I had none in the world which did
          know which was my mother's and which was my husband's good but
            she. So, she went into the house along with them and showed which
            was my mother's beds and other goods in every room belonged to her:
            for she knew all the marks and had marked most of them.
          And for the pewter brass and all else could be done was her name set
           on them before her death who, like a wise and prudent parent, did
           thus to prevent any disturbance might fall out afterwards.
           When Robert saw that Daphne did own that most of the
            household goods to be my dear mother's, by the marks and Daphne's
            testimony to them: 'What', said he, 'we shall have at this rate to
          be my lady Wandesford's that is in the house; here is little or none
            for Mr Thornton then'.
          
           To which Daphne presently returned answer again: 'Sir,
           if I were called to my oath, I must take it that what I say
           is true concerning these goods. They are all my lady's and all of
           them was set down in an inventory before her death by her order',
           and she (seeing them done before her own self and was appraised all
           after her death) 'which is to be yet seen, I believe, in my mistress, her keeping, 
         
            and Mr Thornton had not a bed or any household goods in
          this house or anywhere-else before he married but what he
           had from my lady, and she gave them to my mistress to use. But not
           pay debts but out of kindness to assist them in their house'.</span>

    <span class="event" id="ev132b-start">
          After this, the appraisers went on with their work and when
          they come to the scarlet chamber they
               
             valued the bed and
            the hangings of it, with the stools and chairs (six of them) with the
            counterpane, rug and blankets, and a little ordinary bed which was
          bought by us. The rate was set on them to be by Mr Denton
          of Nawton to be worth £40
            and so set it down in the appraisement.
         
         
           At which, Thomas Thompson, judging it to be very high and above far the worth of it, came to Daphne and myself and
          told me that he was against it and did speak his mind, but that
           Mr Denton of Nawton said he was an appraiser at Mr Gibson's, when
           Sir John died, and they had a bed which was not so fine a colour nor made
          so fine a show which was appraised higher.
           So, after, my brother Denton came into my chamber and
          said he doubted they had done amiss in overvaluing the scarlet bed. I asked, what the rate was set on it? He answered, £40 
            but doubted it was too much.
         
           Upon which I told him, I should be glad it would give as
           much and since I desired to buy the goods and pay for them again,
          rather than expose them to a more disgraceful view which was
           a dishonour to Mr Thornton. But if they could make that money
           of that bed, they were welcome to it for I could not give it.
           And I could make it appear by my cousin Beal's notes, who
            bought the goods at London, that all she bought for that sale did
            but cost £25,  so that, if they was so appraised and I had paid so much
            before of my mother's money, I had better never own them.
            It would ruin me to pay so, and I would not have it.
           On which my brother went out again, after I told him
            to answer the objection of Mr Denton's about Sir John Gibson's bed. I
            knew it and had taken good notice of it, being a very rich hand-silk, damask bed with all answerable to it of the same and a large one;
            the bed being a noble down bed, with bolster pillows, blankets and
            all suitable which I am sure was never bought for £60,
             so that £40  for
            it was an indifferent price for that.
          But mine was but a serge bed and what belonged to it but was
           a light colour, made a show, but that would yield no such price.
           After this discourse, I suppose, they fell off that price was set
           when they heard I could not meddle with it at that rate.
           Yet whatever rate was set on that and the great parlour too
            was very unreasonable, having bought and paid for them
          before, which yet out of my love I had for my husband's family
          I was content to do, though I borrowed every penny of it and paid
          his debts with it. And I know we had not one cow for milk
          but what was my dear mother's and the sheep was bought with her
          money

            and several of the best horses we had was all hers, and he sold them
            and made use of the moneys.</span>

      <p id="div-016"><span class="event" id="ev133-start">
         
           Before I pass to another subject, I think it but fit to give an
          account of a very material accident which fell out for me to struggle
          withal in the first month of my widowhood, which though I
          had been given some notice of by my good Lady Fairfax
           sometime after Mr Thornton was returned from Scarborough.
         
           Videlicet: she coming to see me one day, it happened that my
          dear husband had been in a fit of the palsy and was ordered
           by Dr Wittie to have a bath which I made according to his direction.
          My Lady just came when he was in it and had been prettily
          recruited while he was in the bath and would have had me gone
          to my Lady while he was in it. But I durst not leave him so
           long, only stepped to her Ladyship and told her which she would stay
          until had laid him safe in bed after it.
         
           Which I did and went down to my Lady again, which good
           Lady did much pity my condition, asked me did I not
          hear anything of Mr Thornton's making a bargain when
           he was at Spa to sell all the wood at Newton and Leysthorpe.
          At which news I was much concerned and said, 'No, Madam'.
          She prayed me then not to be troubled at it but assured me
           it was so and some base fellow — taking advantage of his illness
           in his head sometimes — had got him in an humour and had
           made him sell all his wood he had, and at a pitiful rate as she
           heard. And was very sorry for it; therefore, she came on purpose
          to let me know that I might take some course to save it.
          I returned her Ladyship humble thanks and had saved the wood
           several times and should be very sorry to live to see it destroyed;
           so, my Lady went away and left me in much concern

             lest he might

               

            
           cut it down sometime or other, but durst not own it to him.
         
         
    
         
           But now, after Mr Thornton's death, there comes a man
           called Kendall, a wright, and cuts down one of the best fine oak
           trees in the park, without acquainting any with it. Afterwards, he
           comes to my brother Denton telling him that Mr Thornton, when
           he was at Scarborough, had sold to him all his wood at Newton and
           at Leysthorpe, for a considerable sum of money and taken of him
          twenty shillings in earnest of the bargain.
         
           And he now came to have his bargain performed and had
          witness of it, and could make it good, and he had cut down 
          one of the trees in the park as part of the bargain and expected
          it should be performed by me for all the rest.
         
           My brother told him he never heard anything from Mr
             Thornton of it in his life and did believe if it were so he should have
           told him. Besides, the estate is now in another hand, and he
           was sure I — to whom it did belong now — would not grant that
          the wood should be destroyed. And he was mistaken to think


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.131&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 131</a>






         he should have liberty to cut a stick down, and was questionable
           for what he had done. But he would let me know what he said.
         
           When my brother told me this matter, I then called to 
          mind what my Lady Fairfax had told me and feared it was
           too true, but how to preserve the wood I was desirous to consult
           with him; telling him that, by the grace of God, he should never have

            
           his design to destroy that beauty of the estate as long as I lived.
           I loved it and had preserved it thus long, and this man was
          a knave to take the advantage of my dear husband to draw
          him into a snare in his weakness.
         
           In conclusion, we had much to do to break this bargain,
           and I utterly refused, and threatened to punish him for the trespasses
           he had done to come into my ground to do it. So, at last, for
          fear I should question him for it, my brother advised either
           to give him the 20 shillings my husband had received, or to give him the
          tree he had cut down.
         
           But Kendall would have both; so, to be quit of a knave and to
           quit  the bargain, I paid him the 20 shillings and he was to make
           me a discharge — under hand and seal — to renounce all his title
           claim or demand to the same bargain of the wood forever. And
           this tree which he had was valued to be worth £5 or £6.
         </span>
         
         
           Thus, by the good hand of providence to me, his poor servant,
          was I delivered from this great evil of destroying this
           benefit of the estate and I hope to preserve it for my husband's
           posterity. I, ever making it my endeavour to increase the wood
          by planting and letting young trees, which if I could have secured
          as well as I would — or as I have done to all the plane trees
           or sycamores, which I brought from Hipswell and nursed them
          in the orchard until fit to set in the rows and walks in the front
           of my house — there would have been in the park and elsewhere
           many hundreds than ever was cut in my time. 
         
            For I ever took a delight both in the ornament of
          it as well as the pleasure and profit of it on any land.
          Therefore, will I bless and praise the Lord, my God, for his
          great mercy in preventing so great a loss to fall on me and
           mine as this would have been, and in giving me his help to
           prevent such a wickedness as this man would have done to
           my dear husband in his weakness (which I am sure he never
           would have done in his perfect understanding and health). But
          I will never forget to praise our God for this mercy and all else
           showed to me since I was a widow, and in <span class="quote">all the days of my
             life</span>, for his preventing grace and providence. Praise the Lord forever.
          Amen.

    <span class="event" id="ev135-start">
         
           After this appraisement was made, and they had rated according
           to their judgement, it came to the sum of 
            with what was bought with my dear mother's money and her stock
           and cattle (which Mr Thornton bought but never paid for them) was all 
          it came to 

         
         
           But, in regard that there was some which was so cross
          towards me to judge that the appraisement was done in favour to me
           — because I was to buy them off the administrator to pay the debts —
           my brother Denton and myself considered it was best to prevent
           scruples to have a second view, and a new appraisement done by
           some others in different neighbours, and have them appraised again
           which was done by my desire. And so there was Mr Morrett
             and
            was desired to do that kindness for us, and what they
          did rate the goods and whole inventory at I was willing to
           pay at the full value for them; offering them, if they pleased to
           get them sold for that they were now on the review
           set at,
          which was 
         
         
           I would give more; being unwilling the house should be
           dismantled and exposed to sale in a public manner to the dishonour
           of my dear husband (that it should be said, he died in so
           much debt that none of his friends or me, his wife, would undertake
           them for his credit or my children's cause).
      </span>
         
         
           So that, though I was reduced to so low an ebb in my
          estate and my dear husband by many pressures, engagements and
           suits (upon the former account given in this Book and in my
             two first) in relation to the family; yet, I did bear so
           great and sincere love and honour for my dear husband and children
           and family, and for his memory that I did not leave one debt
           unpaid that ever he had contracted (justly proved) that any man
           could challenge that he owed them. And this, I may truly say,
          I did out of a good conscience both towards God and man.
         
           Though it reduced me to great straits to borrow great and
           many sums of money to discharge all that was laid on me. As:

      
         
            
             First, for the discharge of funeral expenses, with all that
               belonged to that sad occasion;
         
         
            
           The renunciation of the administration to Mr Norton;
         
         
            
             Then charges of the appraisement at twice, for the first and
               second review;
         
         
            
           Charges of the administration;

           Charges in payment of all manner of debts;
         
        
               
         
            
           Charges of the tuition of my children and what belong to
             the guardianship of my three children, besides the maintenance
             and education of my son, Robert, and his two sisters, Alice and
             Katherine;
         
      

         
           The charges of whose education, being of many years'
           continuance, must be entered hereafter under each of their
          names in a proper place; consisting of many and several occasions
           and disbursements in their minorities, and more expenses as
          they came at their several ages and changes of their
           conditions to the 
         

         
           As to the education, maintenance and learning of my
             dear son Thornton will amount to so prodigious a sum as
          perhaps may not be credited. But it was the great concern
          of my days, how to find supplies for him when he was to go
           out abroad to the university, in order to make him a scholar
           to which he was designed by God's grace and his own choice and inclination, and my sacred vows to Almighty God if he would please
           to grant my humble petition of a son, as his servant, Hannah,
           dedicated Samuel to the Lord.
         
           Even so did I dedicate my son to the service of the Lord,
           if he would vouchsafe to grant me that blessing, he should be given
          to my God to serve him at his altar and ministry of his holy word
           and gospel. To which petitions the Lord, my God, did please to
           say, Amen. And, in his due time, gave him that happy opportunity
           to preach his gospel and, I trust in his mercy, he became an instrument
           of saving souls. Glory be to the <span class="quote">Lord God of heaven</span> for his
           infinite providence and calling him to that faith and way of salvation.
         
           But, before this great concern came to be in agitation
           of my son, very many transactions and great occurrences fell
           out for me to act in this world; my life being full of various and
           great changes, whose remarks must be taken notice of by me in
           order as they happened. In all which, I am obliged abundantly
          to take care to render my humble thanksgivings for all his
           infinite providences and mercies showed to me in a singular manner.

           For although I was upon these, and many more accounts formerly
           mentioned, forced to make use of my friends' kindness and to borrow
           many sums of money to discharge what I was creditably obliged;
           yet, it pleased God so to order things to be some comfort in the
           midst of my sorrows and sufferings, I found many good
          friends which was willing to lend me money.
          Some upon my own single bond: videlicet, as my lady Cholmley
           lent me £50;
           my Lady Yorke lent me £100;  Daphne did
           procure for me £50. All which I took as a high favour from God
           to assist me until I got them in some time paid, with due interest.
          But I could not compass the greater sums I had need
           of without some friend to be bound with me, so was forced to
           have a friend to be joined with me (though I remember Mr John
             Hicke, my husband's old friend, did lend me £150  of my own
           security which is all paid with due interest long since, I bless God.)

          But it was a very pushing
             consideration to me that I was
          forced to enter the first concern of my widowed condition with
           bonds, debts and engagements for others, whereas I brought so
          considerable a fortune and never knew what debt was to others
          but what I had been serviceable to many in necessity to lend for
          charity. But it was the good pleasure of my God to bring me
           into this dispensation; therefore, do I humbly beg his mercy
           and grace to endure it with patience, and to bring me out of
          debt and that I may <span class="quote">owe no man
           anything</span> (as St Paul saith)
           <span class="quote">but love which is the fulfilling of the law</span> <span class="quote">for Jesus Christ's sake</span>. Amen.
           
         Here, enter in order, the funeral expenses and charges,
            
          with the dates and several sums for that occasion,
           with the rest of charges of the next and dates.

      <p id="div-017">

         
           All the time of my great sorrows and piercing calamities,
           I laid in my sorrowful bed, being overwhelmed with one
           trouble after another, which so depressed my heart that
           it was next a miracle that I could be supported (having
          that pungent trial of the unjust slanders and abominable lies
           cast upon my chaste and untainted reputation).
       
           And, as if all conspired to destroy me with a second blow, this
           was not enough. But on my renewed repetitions of my remote
           enemies, still my miseries was raised up afresh, like <span class="quote">Job's messengers, one after another</span>, which again repeated fresh quails of sighs
         and tears, ready to swallow me up
      
         
            for the dreadful loss of my most dear and precious 
          husband stuck me to my heart who helped to bear me up in all
           my sufferings. This was a doubled calamity. Both to lose the joy
           of my life, and the blessing of my life taken from me by the devil
           and his instruments in the comfort of my good name to be so
          blasted for the performance of my duty.
         
           Added to this, the weak and sick and fainting of my
           spirits, which was ready to sink under each moment and to make
           a separation betwixt my soul and my body; while I not only laid
          under spiritual afflictions but bodily extremity, loss of almost
           all the dearest concerns of this life, together with great burdens
           of debts, troubles, and great and heavy burdens to undergo in the
           managing of an estate which was ready to swallow me up.
          So that I had more than ordinary afflictions on my
           weak spirit all at once, which did so work on me that I had
          no way to fly from them but only to cast myself down
           at the <span class="quote">throne of grace</span>, mercy and divine assistance. For none
           but Christ could support my miserable soul; he, <span class="quote">who hath healing
          under his wings</span> to help, relieve, heal and support me under
           these calamities and make me to endure the fire of these sufferings, until
          he has purged away my sins which makes me unworthy of his
           mercies, and that <span class="quote">for Jesus Christ, his sake</span>. Amen.

          But still I must lie under the hand of a gracious God
           and merciful Father, who has wounded me, and he can heal
           either by means or without, as he in wisdom sees fit, to make me 
           to perform my duty to his majesty and my poor children; for
           whose sake and provision, I have been suffered to fall into the hands 
           of the wicked. And I hope his holy majesty will see fit — in his
           good time — to vindicate my cause to clear my innocency and
          to prosper all those honest endeavours and designs for the good
          of this poor family.

           Yet will I not forget the goodness of God to me, abundantly
           showed to my drooping spirits, by the many kind and affectionate
           testimonies of my friends' letters, and consolatory advices and
          affectionate letters written to comfort me in my sorrows and loss of
           my dear husband (as well as under that other calamity).

      
         
            
           
    
             
             In the first number was my husband's sister, my kind and
             good friend, though of the Roman religion was ever my true friend.
               Her letter (dated September 19, 1668) sent by her son to see me.
           
         
         
           
           
    
             My next was my cousin, Alan Ayscough, writ a kind letter to me
             upon Mr Thornton's decease, his trouble for his loss (September 21, 1668).
           
      
         
            
             
           
               The third, which condoled my loss and gave me a comfortable letter and advice
               in my most heavy condition, was good Dr Wittie, who, by the good
               providence of God, on his advice was the means to raise him up at
               Stearsby in his first dreadful fit of the palsy, and had very often
          been instrumental to his recovery of many relapses and who was now
               called to him at Malton, but in vain for God had determined to take
               my dear joy from me.
         

              
                This good doctor writ a most comfortable letter to bear his loss with
           patience from the consideration that he was taken away from future evils.
           (His, dated September 24, 1668.)
      
           
      
         
            
           
    
             
               My dear niece Best, her most kind letter, condoling my loss and
               my great affliction on the account of Mrs Danby's wicked tongue. (This
               letter dated November 1668.)
           
      
         
            
           
    
           Dr Samways, his comforting letter for the death of my dear husband
             and other afflictions. (Dated October 12th, 1668.)
           
         
         
            
           
    
             
               My dear Lord Frescheville, his very comfortable letter on the death of
               my dear husband, and that he will ever be my friend and assistant in all my 
               concerns. (Dated October 18, 1668.)
           
         
         
            
           
    
           My dear niece Fairfax, her compassionate letter after Mr Thornton's death,
             though not so  soon as others expressed yet as faithful to my affection. (Her letter,
             dated November 20, 1668.)
           
      
         
            
           
    
           My dear aunt Norton, her most dear and tender concern for
          me in the loss of my dear husband, and the lamentable condition I
              was in by the hand of God on my body, soul, spirit and estate, and
             tells me she will come over to comfort me if she can do me any service.
             Her letter (dated September 19, 1668) sent on purpose to enquire of my health and
               my children's.
           
         
         
            
           
    
             Daphne Lightfoot's honest and kind letter, since she went from me
               home, and sorrow I was still so weak and sick, and prayed me to take comfort in
               the Lord and he would take care of me and bring me out of all my troubles.
             Dated November 8, 1668. She would come next week to Newton.
           
         
      

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.140&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 140</a>






            

         
           In this letter of Daphne's to me, she tells me that she came
           away from me and left me so weak and sick in bed, yet there
           was a providence in her return home; for <span class="event" id="ev138-start">my dear aunt
             Norton had discoursed with her concerning my affairs, and had
          heard how all my troubles increased by the envious malice of
           Mrs Danby, being turned out of my house by Mr Thornton before
          his death for her wrongs and abuses of me.

      
        
       
           But though she had vowed to Mr Thornton and herself — that, as
        she had never seen or known anything evil in or of me in
           her life, so she never would repeat or report of anything of that 
        nature she had heard from others but would vindicate my
           honour
             as long as she lived —

               

         
         
            yet now (contrary to her oaths to herself and my
             husband) she was so full of malice against me and Mr Comber
          that she had made abundance of stories up to Dr Samways
           against him (because she could not prevail to break the
          match with my daughter and to have had him married with
        
           that Mrs Batt she brought to Newton to break this match,
           and have that woman to have him and would have lived with them).
      
       
           She, having gotten Dr Samways to dine with her at York,
           had so far prevailed with him against Mr Comber that he,
           good man, was imposed upon by her cunning tongue to get
           my Lady Yorke (my near and dear kinswoman and my daughter,
             Alice, her godmother) to be incensed against him for some
          misdemeanour of his to some person (but cleared me)
      
         
               that it was not fit my daughter should be married to
          him, and that the doctor would come with my aunt to break this
           match, desiring my aunt that she would go with him to do it.
        
        But my dear aunt answered that she would not go to Newton
           until Daphne came home, which would tell her the truth of what she
           knew of all things if she saw any motive in him that he did
           not carry as a wise, sober person. But if he did so, as she saw no
           other cause to believe, she would not design to prevent it
           which might, if it please God, prove a happy match for her
           (he being so great a scholar and ingenious person).
      

         
           But Daphne did hear that there was a conspiracy betwixt
           Dr Samways, Mrs Danby and my Lady Yorke that my
          Lady Yorke was resolved to come over to Newton in order to
           prevent; that the match should be broken and that she would
           come to pretend to have my daughter, Alice, with her to York


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.141&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 141</a>






           (under pretence of having her to be confirmed)
             and so to
          have prevented the match to go forward. This my dear
            aunt told Daphne, upon which Daphne did inform me of it,
          and said all those which was my friends and sincerely wished me
          well did advise me to put an end to this long-designed match
            
          which would make them despair of breaking it.
         
              And she designed to come over to Newton the next 
          week and do me what service she could but in the meantime to
           be very careful of my daughter: for it was intended to steal
          her away and all contrivances was laid out for it.
           </span>
         
       

         
           Thus, I had more bitter pills prepared for me and my dear 
             child, who Satan set all his tools on work to undermine my
          comfort in the disposal of a comfortable husband for my child,
           and for the happy education
               
             and instruction of all my children
           in the true faith of our church, which had been my great endeavour to establish ever since I came into this family.
     
         
           If Mrs Danby had known any ill thing by Mr Comber,
           why then was she so false and treacherous to me — her only friend
           that had relieved and kept her and hers for above 20 years, at
           most, of my poor patrimony my dear mother gave me for my
           relief and my children?
      
       
           Which, if she had known what was not fit for me to marry
           my child to him, why would she then be so false to me and 
           mine to betray us to such an one and advise us to it, and so have
           made us most miserable, when it was her duty to have told
           me? And she knew, in her own conscience, that I had told her
           upon these reports that if she knew anything of him, or if I
           could be sure he was guilty of any such which the slanders
         had spoken and laid it on — whom denied it on oath which I had made
         enquiry of —
      
         
           I did protest solemnly, as a Christian, I did so much
           hate all tendency to evil, that I would first go with my
           dear child to her grave before I would marry her to any such
           which was guilty of such odious things and that I would break that match.
         
           To which she,  seeing me in such concern, did vow she did
           never see or hear any immodest thing from him and did not
           believe any ill thing of him. And if she did, she would have
           told me of it.

         
           (Since then, this woman had made so full a clearing of him
           to me concerning his being wronged and my own concern.)

           Or how dares one, under the notion of so pious a person as
           she was accounted, make no more conscience out of a private
           end to blaspheme the honour and reputation (both of myself
           and a man she so doted on) to have had him matched to
           Mrs Batt and that she knew was so much scandalised, 
      
         
               yet still now to go on in her perfidious treachery to
           both to me (an innocent creature) and to make her private
           ends out of others to abuse such good persons (my friends)
          and bring an eternal blot on our injured persons and
          <span class="quote">good name</span>?
       
              But still Satan is at work to ruin me in
           all the comforts of my life; <span class="quote">as he followed up against Job</span>, so
          doth still raise and stir up my dear and kind friends to
           make them be turned my enemies; for when he could not
          prevail against me to make my dear husband my
           enemy — nor ever had the least misgiving thought of me,
           as he ever did own to me and all my friends in my distress, 
      
         
            though this Danby, he did say, would have tempted him
           to it, but he hated her for it and would not endure her tongue —
           now Satan, by her works with that instrument to ruin my repose
          and rest in a good conscience, has prevailed to incense my
          friends and has set my Lady Yorke and Dr Samways on
           work to begin a new persecution of me, and my dear child,
          by hanging
             and forging of slanders against Mr Comber as the
          only speedy means to prevent that lawful marriage.
      

         
       
           To that end, I received another kind letter from my
          good aunt in making some great remarks of my great
           sorrow to be beyond the bounds of what I ought, for none can believe
          me to be so fallen off or degenerate from those pious principles
           since my infancy; yet, I ought not to be overwhelmed with it,
          <span class="quote">for God's mercy was so great that he would not lay anything
           to his elect: who then can charge them? It is Christ that justifies</span>.
      
         
           After which, she assures me that she had come to see me and
           give me some comfort in my great distress now, in my concern
           upon me as to the disposal of Mr Comber, some other way 
           to satisfy all the world in my proceeding; to be wise and discreet,
           and that she heard Mr Scott had some who would be proper (as
          she heard) which would compose the business in hand.
           Thus far, good woman, she went as to the breaking of our match.
           
           
          To which I returned answer that if I were anyway 


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.143&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 143</a>





       
         conscience
           to myself, or of Mr Comber, his deservings to be
          as our enemies has devised slanders on purpose to destroy
         my comforts in my own innocency and in his — for aught I
           ever see to him in his behaviour since I knew him — 
      
         
               I should not put my friends to any trouble to propose
          any medicine to put an end to my afflictions or this match
            (which was to begin so long since and upon such good and just
           consideration, having an eye first for the honour
           of God in it). 
         
         
              But should be more zealous to prevent proceedings
          than the whole world could be, as my nearest concern to my
          spirituals and temporal for the establishment of the faith in
           my family. And this is my chiefest joy to have, and grief to
          forgo, without greater cause than all our enemies' inveterate
           inventions to destroy my life and honour, goods and good name
          altogether with one blow.
      
         
              But I trust and rely only on the mercy of our gracious
           Father of heaven, if it may be for his glory, the church's good
           and my family's support, he will grant a blessing to our design
          as I have very often supplicated heaven for his direction
          and will depend upon his providence.
      
       
       
    
         
           After this letter to my aunt, poor, honest Daphne
           writ me a second letter to let me know she heard how much
           I was grieved and afflicted, with sickness and extreme sorrows of
           all kinds, and was troubled that my Lady Yorke had been with me
          and had brought me into greater sorrows.
         
           Which Daphne was grieved for (that she was come to torment me
           and not done me no good but hurt) and prayed to God to comfort me.
          She had hired a horse to have come immediately to me to 
           Newton to have told me <span class="event" id="ev143-start">the cabal was so great that Mr
             Darcy was for turning Mr Comber out of the house, and my Lady
          Yorke for coming to forbid the match herself, or if she could
           not break the match, she would steal my child away.
      
         
              But my friends did advise by all means to wish Daphne
           to let me be married and then they would be content, but my
          Lady Yorke often inquired when it would be that she might
           prevent it, but none could tell her for they knew not of it.
         
           So, Daphne begged for God's sake and my poor children's
           sake to have care of my own life, for they were ruined if
          that by too much pressure on my spirit I should die, and withal
          to take care of my dear child who they laid at wait to
          take from me by stealing her from me, and when she came


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.144&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 144</a>






            
           

           she would give me a fuller account of all intrigues (which was done
          by Mrs Danby's instigation of Dr Samways and from him
           to my Lady Yorke, who was so deluded against Mr Comber
          that she would not be so kind and Christian to me as to come
          and acquaint me with what was informed against him,
          but rather to take this cruel way to rob me of my dear
            and eldest child without cause but an incensed malice).
      
       

         
           But when Daphne went home, she did vindicate
          Mr Comber's cause and clear those ignominies cast on him which
           was invented to ruin my poor family. Good God, what can
           not a witty, lying tongue work of mischief, being set on fire
           of hell? I beseech thee, O Lord, to forgive them and punish the evil
           doer which has hatched all this wickedness from hell. Prevent all
           those wicked designs against those that are thy servants, and
           <span class="evquote">do thou bring good out of evil for thy mercy's sake</span>. Amen.
      
         
           Oh, direct and go along with all our honest designs, bless
           our endeavours for thy kingdom and the good and comfort of
           my dear child; make her an instrument to <span class="evquote">bring forth
           children</span> that might increase thy kingdom and be a 
           comfort to me, thy poor, oppressed handmaid, <span class="evquote">for Jesus
             Christ, his sake</span>, and to convert all my enemies. Amen.
      
       
    
         
           After this, Daphne came the second time to Newton
          and found me so very weak still on the new sorrows and
          calamities brought on me by the false accusation of this
           woman, Mrs Danby, and the incensing of the doctor and my Lady
          Yorke to have utterly discarded and broken the marriage
           with Mr Comber. It was, indeed, very bitter to me and my
            dear child to be done in so vile and scandalous manner
           from such false instigations.
      </span>
       
       
       
    <span class="event" id="ev145a-start">
         
           But Mr Comber, valuing his honour and vindicating
           the same, having this belief the design was from Mrs Danby —
           who solicited him for Mrs Batt — did make so full proof of his
           wronged innocency and, being very earnest to have the business
           concluded, desired me to take those true friends' advice that 
          knew the state of all things amongst us.
      
         
              And by the grace of God to let the marriage proceed with
           what conveniency of speed and secrecy we could, and he did
           not doubt (if, please God, he lived) would make it appear by
          his life and conversation to confute all those odious scandals
           against him. And that, if I pleased to give consent, he might
          enjoy his long-desired happiness in my daughter in marriage
          that she should live as comfortably and as happy in a 


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.145&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 145</a>






           a dear and affectionate husband, as if she had married to a
          great estate; for riches could not make one happy without
          the grace of God, which he humbly begged to guide and go
          along with him in all his ways.
         
           I told him withal (as my dear husband said when
           he asked his consent to have my daughter in marriage) that
          though he had a kindness and good opinion of him before another and there was no haste, she was young enough and did
          not think of marrying her so soon. It were better to stay a
          while longer until she were in years more accomplished.
      
         
              And it was not my judgement to bring her too soon
           into the married estate (being so hazardous in bearing children)
           and should be greatly afflicted if, upon so early a marriage,
           she should have her life endangered which would be the most
           saddest thing that could befall me.
         
           To which my objection, he did believe it might be so
           indeed to me, so indulgent a parent, but did faithfully
          protest to me that he had so great and tender an affection
           for Mrs Alice Thornton

           above all the world, that he would
          not for his own life hazard hers in that kind but preserve
           it by all means possible, nor should not desire children
           until it please God she was more capable without danger.
       
           And another argument he used: that whereas he
          had set his desires and affections so on her virtues and deserts that
           he had denied himself of the proposal of Dr Stone's (his daughter)
           which had £1500  portion (and several others forsake) so, he did
           believe, if I should be taken away by death (which God forbid)
          that her seeming friends would strip him of her and he
           never should obtain his so long desired happiness. 
      
         
            And he saw under what affliction I lay in, which made him
          doubt very much my illness should prove dangerous and so
          begged of me to grant his request.
         
           I told him upon his former assurances and that I should
           advise with my friends in this concern, which was so great to me
           as the disposal of my eldest child, and begged the assistance of God
          to direct me for the best.
         
              And withal I did expect the full performances and agreement of those articles, long since drawn by him, to be drawn in
           form of law, with his bond for performance to establish all her
            
           fortune upon my daughter and her issue, male or female, with other
           clause for the benefit of my dear son, Robert, her brother.

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.146&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 146</a>






            

         
           To which he answered that he was not only willing to make
           the best assurances I would, or he could of her own fortune,
           but was resolved, if ever God enabled him with an estate, to
          settle all he had upon her and hers.
         
           And this very promise he made to Sir Christopher Wandesford, my
             brother, soon after his marriage, which Sir Christopher Wandesford told
           him he did expect of him, 'because, Sir', said he, 'my niece marries
           you to a great disadvantage to her; she having a present
           fortune and born to a partition of her father as next heir to her
             brother, we shall expect this from you'.
      
         
           To which discourse Mr Comber did positively answer: he
          would do all that her friends thought fit in this particular and
           did find himself in honour and conscience to perform by the grace
           of God.
         
           After the assurances given to me (as before mentioned,
          as well to my brother Denton as myself) and upon the news
           that Daphne brought of some designs to prevent it, and my
           own daily weakness increasing, fearing I should leave all my
            poor young children in a very unsettled condition by their
          father's death and infinite debts to fall upon the estate.
       
           Besides, when both father and mother are both taken away,
           those children are in a forlorn condition for tutors or governors,
            guardians or true friends to take care of them. And here
           was a providence offered; by the disposal of my eldest, all the
         other I might hope for would be taken care for 
         
            (by leaving my son, Robert, in the hand of a good and wise
           and learned man, who would by God's blessing see him brought
          up in our faith and gospel, and able to instruct his younger and
           and riper years in our true Church of England, according to
          my humble petitions to heaven in his behalf).
         
           All these great things considered, I was the rather more
          inclined to grant to Mr Comber's request that I might
           see this good work done before I died, which I had daily cause
          to prepare for and expect by my daily torments and lies
          raised against me to cut my days off.
      
         
           So, advising with my brother Denton in the case and making him fully acquainted with the endeavours to take my child
           from me, knowing all the wrongs and injuries done to me by
          Danby and the rest, as also of the concern of marriage from the
           first motion, upon all these reasons did join with
        us in our
          affair and was willing to draw up and engross all those
           terms, articles and agreements before marriage to which Mr
          Comber had


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.147&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 147</a>






           freely and fully consented to, and drew up the first
          draft of those articles with his own hand when he
          had first hopes of this marriage.</span>
       

         
           Therefore, how false and abominable was those scandals
           imputed by hell and his instruments, which said I was forced to
          marry my child to hide my own blame or dishonour.
         
           But, O <span class="quote">thou, great searcher of all hearts</span>, the God of
           truth, do thou, O Lord, confound all those wicked tongues
          and imaginations which has laid such odious things to
           my charge, and defend my cause against <span class="quote">all the sons and
           daughters of Belial</span>, and do thou justify thy poor servant
          who has been falsely accused, as thou did to thy faithful
           handmaid. And <span class="quote">let the wickedness of the wicked be brought to 
             nothing</span>, and that thy handmaid may be delivered from
           this death and <span class="quote">scourge of the tongue</span> and let me not perish by thy
           scourge who thou canst refrain. Oh, <span class="quote">put a hook into their
          nostrils</span>
             that they may be caused

               
             to confess their wickedness
           to thy glory and their own conviction. O my God, be gracious
          to thy weak handmaid and make me have some comfort in
          the resurrection of my <span class="quote">good name</span> <span class="quote">before I go hence and be no
           more seen</span>. Then will I praise and bless and glorify thy holy name
           forever. Lord, hear my petitions and let my cry come unto
           thee for the <span class="quote">Lord Jesus Christ, his sake</span>, which was scandalised for
           my sake. Oh, <span class="quote">let me endure with patience the chastisements</span> which thou hast
           laid upon me and sanctify all thy dealings with me; I humbly
           beg, in and for the sake of thy dear son, the Lord Jesus, my saviour,
           in whose name and his prayer I call on thee, saying: '<span class="quote">Our father, et cetera</span>'.
      

       
              Having upon mature deliberation with the advice of
           my true friends, consideration of the aforesaid reasons,
          accepted of the motion of this marriage, with the full consent
         of my dear child, who — considering my own circumstances
           and the condition we were reduced into in the estate by her
          father's debts, and my great and exceeding weakness I was brought into by all my griefs and sorrows by death of my dear husband and the horrid slanders raised to prevent this match,
           and that I was nearer death than to live with my children, 
         
               she also considered into a worse state they might be in
           afterwards —
            did very wisely choose to cast herself upon the
          providence of our God for direction in this great change
           and, with myself, humbly begged his blessing and assistance


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.148&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 148</a>






         to go along with us in this concern: that it might be ordered
          by his wisdom for the good of her soul and spiritual concern
           and comfort for this temporal life to her; that he would
          incline her heart to accept of this person, which may be a 
           great instrument of God's glory in this church and for a 
          continuance of this family in the name and fear of God
           and to establish the true faith in this, my children, and if
          it were his pleasure to make her an instrument to <span class="quote">bring
          forth children</span> that might be heirs in the kingdom of
           heaven. And all this for the Lord Jesus Christ, his sake, our
           dear saviour, we begged in her name and for his glory,
           saying as he hath taught us in his gospel, '<span class="quote">Our Father which</span>'.
         
              After we had poured out our petitions to God at
           the <span class="quote">throne of grace</span>, he was graciously pleased to return
           an answer to us, and so ordered all things so as, we hoped,
           would tend to his own glory and our comfort, which was more
          speedily intended to be performed by general consent
           than was before resolved for; instead of those, which was our enemies, to prevent it by private designs of stealing my child
           from me, the grief of which did enforce me to hasten it.
      
         
           For the sooner my death might come, the greater was
          the argument to me to have her disposed to one who did
          make all professions imaginable to be most faithful
           and careful of all my children, and to do all acts of love
           and care and concern for them (both for the good instruction
           of their souls and education, and their bodies and estate).

       
    <span class="event" id="ev146-start">
         
           So that Daphne, coming over to me, told me
          all the intrigues was amongst such as was set against
           me and Mr Comber, did advise and encourage me to prosecute
         this concern with speed, because I was so weak and afflicted
         to get it done, that I might have some comfort of her before
         I died. And it would be a great happiness to have all my
          children placed with so good a sound minister of the
           church of God, which was the greatest motive I had in 
           this world for fear they should be otherwise educated.
      
         
           Thus, what our enemies used as a means to break
           our good designs, God, our gracious Father, made it the more
          speedy to bring it to pass, and we were willing that he
          should go to York after Daphne came to Newton.

           That Mr Comber should go to York to procure the 
           licence to marry my daughter, Alice, which day was on
           the fifth day of November in the year of our Lord,
             1668. I hope it being done of a most eminent day to our
           Church of England — being that very day in which Almighty
          God did show his miraculous deliverances of all our souls
           and bodies (with the whole church of God in the Christian world)
          from that Gunpowder Plot of the bloody papists for our
           utter ruin and subversion when we had cause to rejoice 
         </span> — 
       
         
               I hope in God it may prove as prosperous, blessed and
          happy to the good and establishment of the truth and
           light of God's gospel to be established and preserved in this
           my poor family and blood. And shall be confirmed in me
          and mine as long as the world endureth and for the salvation
          of all the souls that spring from my dear husband and myself, which will be the great blessing I humbly crave of God
           for the Lord <span class="quote">Jesus Christ, his sake</span>. Amen.
       
           And, instead of abolishing, to establish the truth from
           all sects, schisms, heresies or popery or profaneness whatever,
          because this man had set himself to write so many
          learned and orthodox books to vindicate our religion and the
          truth against all falsehoods, he had contracted many
           enemies against him; as well as, I hope, he had been a 
         means to convert many. Yea, very many from the 
          errors in their life and doctrine,
      
         
               which works of his in the church is of more value and riches
          to it than if he had built great and rich edifices and given
          much endowments to its temporal advantages.
         
           For although those are of great honour and esteem that
          are great patrons to the church in any kind, yet it is of
          more glory to God and advantage to the souls of men to 
           be a means of salvation to poor, sinful souls and to
          bring many to righteousness.
         
           So that, though we could not say we married for the riches
          of this life and glorious estate here — indeed this was not my
           thoughts to do so which, if I would have so chosen, I might
           have bestowed my child so (for her having opportunities
          to do it in our nigh neighbourhood) —

       but I may appeal to God that my choice, and my dear
         husband's, was so <span class="quote">to choose for the better part as Mary did</span>,
         which shall I hope never be taken from me or my children
          forever. This is my ground and bottom on what I ever desired
          to fix both in my own choice of a husband for myself
         and my dear children, and I hope I have found a greater
          joy in my own soul in my choice than all the worldly
         riches could afford and so, I humbly trust, shall do for
         all my dear children whom God has given me.
      
       
           And, although all the world shall condemn me, yet shall
           not my heart condemn me since God is on my side. 
         
               And though self-interest shall blast my honest designs
          with false glosses and horrid imputations, <span class="quote">yet in God is my
          trust and in him will I hope for deliverance</span>.
         
              Though malice, hatred, spite and the instruments of
          hell torment me and stirred up my near and dear friends
          to judge rashly (fear I have done amiss) yet will I not
          part with my innocency, virtue, hope, and confidence in
          my great Creator but that he will please to vindicate me
           in his blessings upon my children (though I desire patiently
           to suffer what he pleaseth to bring me to for his holy name's
           sake that I might see what joy this great work of his
           gospel established in my generations). Glory be to him forever
           and ever more. Amen and Amen.

              There was many lies and stories set abroad still to deter and distract my soul, and to prevent this happy design of
          this marriage. As that before poor Daphne came over when
          they heard about Richmond that the marriage was intended my Lady Yorke, which was her godmother, being incensed
           by Dr Samways from Mrs Anne Danby, did protest she
          was resolved to come over herself and use all the means
           she could to prevent it. And that, being her godmother, she
          would either get her away under pretence of having
          her confirmed by the bishop or to use some means to catch her
          from me in secret when she was walking abroad.
      
         
           But this poor, honest woman had notice from my
             aunt, which was set upon to come with Dr Samways to force
           me to break this serious and holy unity, which I had been so long
           in bringing to pass for the foresaid reasons. Thus, have I been tormented by the spleen and malice of hell by Mrs Danby's work.

           But God, having designed a blessing for us, I hope, did
          not let all their stratagems prevail but prevented them
          by Daphne's coming
               
           to Newton, and our resolves to finish
          what was designed sooner than I intended to give all the
          world satisfaction that great occasion I had to provide
           for my children (and Daphne would not give any information
           of the time to my Lady Yorke nor any of them).
      </span>
       
       
    <span class="event" id="ev148-start">
         
           So, after some preparation for this marriage, the
          writings and deeds which Mr Denton had engrossed and
          made ready with a bond of Mr Comber for performance
          of articles and deeds being entered into for security of her
           fortune. The bond was for — 

         
         
           Dated: November 17, 1668. Witnesses – 
         
       
           Mr Charles Man, the minister of Gilling, was entreated to do this kind and friendly office for us to join
           these two — Mr Thomas and my dear daughter, Alice 
             Thornton — in the holy bond of matrimony
      
         
           which was performed in a very decent and a religious
           manner. I, myself, being all the friend she had to stand
           for her father (whom God had taken from us) and gave her
          in marriage, which I could not refrain to shed many tears
           considering how I was left, and she, in a manner, forlorn of all
          our relations who should have been our comfort in this great
          of our change.
      
         
              
                My dear child did carry herself most virtuously and
            modestly, with chastity, in this holy action into which she did come
           and with tears entered into it; begging a blessing of God to his holy
           ordinance we both did, and to which, I humbly bless his holy name,

            
          I hope he gave a gracious return of our prayers.
      
       
          There was witnesses of this sacred marriage being done in the
        scarlet
         chamber: Daphne Lightfoot, Hannah Ableson
          and Mary Lightfoot
         
           which, because it was done in so much secrecy by reason
           of our adversaries' malice, it was not thought fit to have any
          more witnesses for making it public
             sooner than it was convenient to be known for several reasons.
         
           But indeed, I was, with my daughter, very desirous and earnest
           with my brother Denton to have stood for her father to give her in

          marriage, or to have been a witness of it at least. But
           I do not know very well on what account, but for reasons
           best known to himself did desire to be excused to be there, but
          said he wished them much happiness and joy in their
           marriage. So, we had not his company at that time.
         
           I suppose that the rest of the brothers and sisters was
          never well pleased at the disposal of my children in the
          way of marriage for several reasons, and one main one may
          be that the more of my husband's children had children
           the further off the estate would be of descending: as it has
          appeared since my dear son Thornton's decease without
           issue and the daughters saved. (There was £800 to fall to them.)
         
           This business was transacted with great gravity and piety.
           After which, my daughter and myself went to prayer to beg a
           blessing and mercy upon our great undertaking, and though it was
           began with great sorrow and affliction on my part, I hope —
           and put my trust in the living God — he will be merciful to
           me and my dear child, and let us receive the comfort of his
          presence to preserve us from all evil and bless us with all good
           that we may be his faithful servants in all conditions.
       
           The bridegroom, as in those cases, laid down a
          wedding ring and several pieces of gold
          as a token of his faithful and conjugal love to his dear
            bride, over whom he expressed abundance of joy and
          inward satisfaction to have obtained so virtuous and
           chaste a wife of God. And we could not but hope God would
          give them a great share of his favour and mercy to live to his
           glory and praise, and I begged some comfort in them to support
          my sad and sorrowful widowed condition. Glory be to the good
         <span class="evquote">God of my salvation</span> who has performed this mercy
               

             to us,
         
         
            making me to live to see this so happily ended.
           
          But in regard that it was not suitable to publish the
          marriage, being too near the time of my sorrow and great
           mourning for my dear husband, it was by consent thought
          fit that the solemnity of the getting the bride to bed should
          be deferred
           </span>
           <span class="event" id="ev149-start"> until it was convenient to invite all Mr Thornton's
          relations to the publication of their marriage, which was
           done on May (following year) 17th, 1669, when we had all his 
          relations from Malton and elsewhere of kindred and had
           what preparations of entertainment of that occasion.

    <span class="event" id="ev150-start">
         
           Be it remembered that — notwithstanding all the great and
          subtle endeavours of our spiritual and temporal enemies
           to blast the design, to frustrate my family of the great
          blessing and the placing a standing ministry in this place and
           country — this marriage was solemnised in my house by 
          Mr Man upon the 17th day of November in the year of
            1668. And 
         
               another circumstance I desire to take notice of was
         : it was done in that very chamber in which Mrs Danby had been
           hatching and contriving all her malice against us three. Videlicet:
           my son Comber, which now I may call so by virtue of affinity, and
           my poor daughter, Alice, and myself, who being the unfortunate creature against
        whom all those arrows was shot.</span>
       
       
              But by the immense and profound goodness, mercy and <span class="quote">compassion of our gracious father to the widow and fatherless</span> — me,
           his poor servant — did pity my wrongs, heard my griefs and
           tears, and did <span class="quote">bring
               
             good out of this evil</span>, I hope to my
           whole family for whose good I may testify I am a sufferer, 
         
            though, <span class="quote">as David saith, many are the troubles of the
             righteous, but the Lord will deliver
               
             him out of all</span>. And
           thus, I hope in mercy,
               
           he will to me, his handmaid: <span class="quote"> oh, make me
           righteous and then he will, according to his promise, deliver me</span>.
      
         
           My daughter's age was (January

            3rd, 1668) the complete
          age of 16 years.
               
           <span class="quote">Blessed be the Lord <span class="quote">God of my salvation</span>
             for her life</span>, and my glorious deliverance of her from death

           After it pleased God the marriage of my daughter, Alice,
          was perfected and all our
         affairs was ended, I had
          kept Daphne a good while to assist me and to help me
          in my sorrows, which I always found her true and faithful
           to me in my distress, and by her  great pains and diligence,
           she was very serviceable to me and my children.
         
              I feared her husband would be displeased at her
          too long stay when he wanted her at home. I could do
           no less for all her service in this and all the concerns she
           had for me to right my wrongs, and to go to my friends to give
          them a true account of my actions, whereby they found how
          much injury I had laid under and was very sorry for
           so rashly giving ear to Mrs Danby's stories, and said it was
           only malice. And she did show them all the letters which passed
          betwixt Mr Comber and my daughter ever since the year
          1666 when the match was begun.
      </span><span class="event" id="ev152-start">
         
           Also, the occasion of that acceptance (of my most sad condition by grief upon the cutting off the entail) and forced
           me into a miscarriage and flood on grief on it. I then did
           look for nothing but death and Mr Thornton, so often relapsed into
           the palsy, could expect not long to live. On these great things,
          both myself and husband did consent to a marriage with this
          Mr Comber, which was judged a great scholar and able
          divine and a good husband.
      
         
         
    
         
           So, that being the occasion he was made use of to go upon
           all Mr Thornton's affairs and mine,</span><span class="event" id="ev153-start">she told them also that
          business of the writings and trunk Mr Thornton bid him to keep for 
          me when I laid in of my last child and all that followed of the
           injury I had done by it (which, when Mr Darcy, Mr Edrington,
           Dr Samways, Uncle Norton and Aunt heard, they was all
          very much troubled for my false slanders laid on me for doing
           my duty to God and my husband and children).
      
         
              And whereas they were all my enemies and my son
                Comber's before, they, by God's mercy, was turned to pity me
           for all the great afflictions laid on me and prayed for me. And said
          they were glad that Daphne did bring them this account of the
           business and my uncle Norton said, 'If they were married,
           God speed them well and send them a happy wedding'.
         
           But told Daphne, why would I not let them lie together?
          She said it was done by their own consent that being not to be
           made public until a while after, and then they was to lie together.

           So, after Daphne went home, it pleased God — by her true
          and honest account of my actions and of the good carriage
           of Mr Comber,</span> I bless God for it — all that was my true Christian friends, without partiality, was very joyful and glad
          and thanked Daphne for her great kindness and duty to
          me.
      
         
              Nor did she deserve less at my hand. Not knowing
           how greatly I was obliged to my God in the first place, who
           is my Creator and preserver and author of all good to me,
           to whom be all glory, honour and praise forever for his infinite
          favour to me in giving me this good woman to vindicate
           myself from those wrongs the devil and man had raised.
         
    <span class="event" id="ev154-start">
         
           I did give her, for herself, as a token of gratitude,
          a young cow and calf to sustain her house with other good
          things which she had deserved for her faith and fidelity to me and
           my poor children. And sent her husband a Bible and 1 lb  of tobacco.
           </span>
          

         
    
         
      
            
           After her going home, I received letters from her and my aunt
          which gave me great comfort. For Daphne had informed my dear
          aunt of all proceedings and how I was compelled to have the
          marriage sooner solemnised in regard of my own sickness
          and weakness, which I foresaw was very necessary to be done.
         
         
           For if I should have been taken away from my family,
           all things would have been in an utter confusion and my
          children would not have had any to take care of them or
          look after debts, but those whose interest was to pay none or
          was it indeed to be expected from those who was to succeed
          as heirs in the estate. And this was the main reason, as to the
          preservation of both temporal and spiritual concerns of this
           my poor, desolate family, solely destitute of friends or advice
           or counsel when all the load fell on my shoulder to bear,
          which was ready to sink under the heavy hand of God.
      

         
              After Daphne had made a full relation of my sad condition
           as to the estate and my children, and to the great affliction which did
           torment me — for the bringing of this great blessing to my children and
          family to support it from ruin — by the continual clamours and raised
           slanders (both before and since this happy match) because they failed
          of their desired end to have routed me and my posterity from off the
           earth, and <span class="quote">that I only bore the burden of day</span> and was reduced
               
             to death
          by the devil and hell for doing my duty,

           it pleased my gracious God and merciful Father to look on
           my sufferings for the truth's sake (and the conscience I had for his
           church and my children, and so sincere a cause) to make me to
           find some pity and compassion amongst my own relations,
           who had been stirred up against me by malicious enemies,
            
           who was enemies to the church of God and hated me for his sake.
         
              <span class="quote">But that great God of compassion had mercy
                on me</span>, and looked on my affliction at last, and would not let me
          be destroyed by hell and his instruments who had always gone
           about <span class="quote">like a roaring lion seeking to devour who he could</span>.
         
         
           But the gracious God, who did withstand his malicious
           practices against poor, innocent Job, did also defend my
          cause and would not give me over into his hand to kill me.
           But, in infinite and miraculous mercy, turned my uncle Norton,
           my aunt, Mr Darcy, Mr Edrington and Dr Samways' hearts
          towards me and to let them see how much I had been wronged
          and horridly abused by false and lying tongues,
      
         
               and did show great sorrow for my sad afflictions and was
          ready to make me any help and give me comfort. So that Daphne
          writ me word that there was none could or had any ill thought
            of me, for what I did was compelled from me. <span class="event" id="ev154a-start">And Mr Norton
           said, 'Why did not they lie together'. Daphne said it was not
          convenient until the publication of the marriage and then it
           should be so. He said it was well done, and very glad it was
           past, and now people might see what care I took of my children.</span>
      

         
      
           But Daphne said that Mrs Danby had still continued her
           horrid lies and slanders against Mr Comber, et cetera, but prayed me to
          be of good comfort and not to grieve at it for none believed
           any ill of me or him. For which mercy and goodness of God, I
          humbly return all possible praise and glory to the Lord God.
      
         

         
    
         
       
           I received also a most dear and pious letter (dated
           January 8th, 1668) of the date with Daphne's second letter, after the
          marriage of my daughter, when I had writ her word to
          acquaint her with it and of my disconsolate condition
          by my great afflictions,
         
            wherein she begs of me not to despair of that great God's
           mercy, which had been my succour and preserver ever since I was born
           and preserved me in the ways of a holy life; that he knows the
          sincerity of my heart, so that she adviseth me not to sorrow too
           much for those abominable slanders; <span class="quote">for God will judge my cause</span>
           and justify my innocency, and deliver me in his good time
         

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.157&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 157</a>






         
           and <span class="quote">make all my enemies ashamed</span>, either in this world or
           in another; praying me to take heed that Satan doth not take any
           advantage to destroy my life and comfort in God, who both had
          and would deliver me, who had brought thus much comfort
          in granting me to live to see my dear daughter so hopefully
           bestowed to one so promising; and begged of God for all happy
          blessings to come upon them and me in this match.
         

         
              I bless God for moving my dear aunt to write so much
           comfort to me in my doleful condition, which did support my
           sad spirits from sinking, and encouraged me to endure this scourge
          with more patience since I had much satisfaction in my young
            couple (whose match was compassed with so great a difficulty).
      
           
    
              But as this was kept with much privacy and not yet come
             to my Lady Yorke's knowledge — because she was, good woman,
           so much imposed upon by Danby's slanders against Mr Comber —

           she, about the 23rd of January 1668/9,
             wrote a very kind and compassionate
            
           letter of her intentions to have come to have seen me (which 
          was in order to have broke the match but was prevented by a
           great cold and was very ill which prevented her).
         
           Yet, she desires, now she is at York, to have her god-daughter to be confirmed by the bishop, it being her duty to present her to him, and she had been confirmed herself.
           And she had heard news of her god-daughter, Alice, that she
           could not believe, that she was already married but she desires,
           according to my prudent actings in other concerns, so I would be advised
          by my best and nearest friends in a matter of so great concernment
           to do accordingly, and wishes I may be directed.
      
         
         
    
         
           To which kind wishes for me, I returned my Lady my answer, 
           January 26, 1668. I returned her Ladyship many thanks for her kind
          and obliging lines to have given me a visit in my saddest affliction
           and distress, wherein I wanted such comforts, which she might have been,
           but would not have had her put to any hazards on that account for me.
      
         
           I also returned her thanks for her care of her god-daughter, Alice,
          in her desire to have her confirmed and that I hoped Almighty God
          would please to give me leave to receive that holy ordinance myself
          and then she shall have the benefit with me.
         
         
           'Madam, I must ever own the Almighty for my first and best
           friend, for such I have ever found him in my greatest extremities
          and needs and in destitution of all other friends. 
         
            And therefore, in the first place, I am obliged to aim at his
          glory and to beg his direction and assistance, which I have principally
          endeavoured to do in this great concern, which is so highly obliging my utmost care for our souls.
         
           As for my other friends, I love not to make comparisons between
           them, but I suppose it is not want of prudence in me,


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.158&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 158</a>






            
         
         
              or of a good opinion of those friends that are far distant
           from me and ignorant of the sad condition my estate is now in —
           being left <span class="quote">a very desolate and sorrowful widow</span> with three children
           and little or nothing to maintain them (clear, without debt) but
          at present my own small jointure — 
         
               if I choose rather to consult in these cases with those who
           know how all matters stands. For though I value them for the nearness of relations and believe they sincerely wish us well, yet,
           except they could be informed how my temporal concerns are,
          they cannot be apt judges of my actions, which I can demonstrate
          to any unprejudiced person to be for the temporal as well as
           spiritual good of this family. And I should be very sorry
          any of my dear friends should censure me for acting for
           the good of myself and poor family.
         
           And I am confident if your Ladyship did truly understand
           the true state of my condition and affairs — with those sad circumstances I am unjustly and maliciously fallen into, to preserve myself and poor children from ruin — you would be so far from
          censuring my actions that you would both pity me and
          compassionate my sufferings, and I hope this will satisfy until we
           have by providence we may meet'.
      
         

         
           After the writing of this letter, it pleased God I heard not
           of those disgusts from thence, but he was pleased to have mercy on
          me and my condition and
             to quiet the spirits of those that was
           stirred up against me, and by degrees was more patient since they saw
          there was nothing but innocency and virtue followed by us.
         
              And those that was so much stirred up by Mrs Danby's malice
          saw there was nothing but that at the bottom, which was blown up to
           make me and mine miserable if they could, but that God of mercy had
          still the over-ruling power over them and made many of them repent
          their rash belief and ask pardon for it.
      
         
    
         
           Dr Samways, which had been a great stickler in the acting about
           the breaking the match by Mrs Danby's false instigation, God did
           make him very sensible what wrong he had done to me and what a
           continued grief and trouble to bear the scourge of the tongue was; so,
           truly sensible of his error, that he writ me a very Christian and
          comfortable letter to alleviate my sorrows and compassionate my
           sufferings of all kinds, with hearty wishes for me and prayers.
      
         
         
           For this, and all mercies of this kind, which did magnify God's
          glory in my sufferings and made it appear that my God did take
           a care of my soul and body, and <span class="quote">my precious name</span>, not letting me
          suffer more than he gave me strength to bear and to be delivered from <span class="quote">this
            scourge of the tongue (as Job, the servant of the Lord, was</span>).

           But, as the wounds of the body are not so soon healed, nor the scars
           thereof worn off, no more can it be possible the <span class="quote">stings of the serpent</span> cannot
           be soon healed, but the poison longer continues before it be drawn out,
          and far longer in curing; many methods used to cleanse and wash them
          with healing medicines, balsams inwardly applied and outward
           salves laid upon the broken wounds, and the deep gashes, which is so
           often irritated,
             and the longer continuance makes the orifices
          so deep until it often proves to a mortification.
         
              And can these great, deep and dangerous wounds of this
          deadly serpent be so soon closed or healed which has been of so long
           continuance, so inward and secret, not to be discovered until by its
           rankling and putrefaction, its pain and smarting, it is discovered to the
          wounded person when the occasion is gone or the serpent fled that
           did it? No, no, the wounds of an open enemy are sooner discovered,
           and the wounds sooner healed, when it is laid open to the eye and some
           speedy applications had to stop its going farther, and so the hurts are quickly cured. 
         
           But the kisses of a Judas betrays the innocent Jesus, when he
           (that was God himself) knew he came to that purpose when he
           told him, '<span class="quote">Betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss</span>?'
         
           <span class="quote">Even so may I say, with David, if it were my enemy, I could
           have borne it. But it was thou, my companion, my friend, my
           counsellor and my adviser which knew all my concerns and actions</span>.
         
           I will not say as he did, '<span class="quote">let death come hastily upon them</span>',
           but oh, let them <span class="quote">live to repent and be converted that they may
           be saved and not perish for this great wickedness</span>.
         
           So, had there need be a great deal of means used, and much
          time taken to heal the wounds given by a friend turned to be an
           enemy. And to this end, God was pleased to do to me as to his servant,
           <span class="quote">Job, to speak to them by the conviction of their consciences to return
           and some make confession</span>; others to give me balsam of advice; and others
           to set themselves on work to write to clear my actions and innocency;
           others to write comfortable letters bemoaning my afflictions.
      
         
    
         
           My niece Best, February 5, 1668, writ a dear and comfortable letter and
          begged of me not to be so afflicted for her sister Kitt's
          
           slanderous lies;
          for she was sorry I had the ill luck to do so much good to her and her
            husband, and she to requite me as she had done all her husband's friends
          and her tongue was no slander.
         
         
         
              My cousin Fairfax writ a most kind and obliging letter condoling my sad loss of her uncle and my great sickness and weakness, with her
          confidence I had chosen a very discreet and judicious person for my
            daughter and wished me and them all happiness and comfort.
           
           So, I received many letters from diverse parts to give me what comfort could
           be. <span class="quote">Blessed be the God of all comfort and consolation</span> who has wounded and

          medicine to heal my sicknesses and infirmities. He has wounded and alone can cure. <span class="quote">He came into the world to cure both souls and

           No Lord, <span class="quote">I believe; Lord, help my unbelief</span>'.
         
    <span class="event" id="ev156-start">
         
         Thou, O my God, didst <span class="evquote">heal my soul</span> and body at Oswaldkirk

           did thou come in to my soul with the beams of thy grace, and <span class="evquote">put the

           So also, in my sad distemper on miscarriage (August  1666)
          near death by that flood, called me to believe by faith as the
             poor
           woman in thy gospel: <span class="evquote">if I may but touch the hem of that garment,

          It is much to be admired, the miraculous power and great
            goodness of Almighty God towards me (a poor, desolate worm)
          that he was pleased to give me strength and renew his mercies
          every moment and to make me subject and endure these great
            storms of temptations, and in the midst of my miseries to
          send me some relief both as to spiritual and temporals.
       
          
              For having been so toxicated by daily evils from <span class="quote">the
                scourge of the tongue</span>, with the heavy load of debts that lay
            on my estate and — which I was compelled to undergo as to that
            payment of them under my cousin Anthony Norton's name —
      
         
             the undertaking of the tuition of my three poor children
           (for whom we could get but small subsistence until the
           tenants would pay until Lady Day came to be due).
         
         
         
              And this to struggle with by a weak, despised and
           afflicted person, sick and fainting every day; though I bless
           God, he gave me necessary comforts to relieve my spirits
          under these calamities, to make me to endure his good pleasure
          which showed his almighty power, mercy and long-suffering to me , his weak handmaid, ever delivering

          me from total sinking in despair that hell and Satan 
           could not prevail over me. And that no sooner a trial came
          upon me of a new assault, but then the Lord caused some
           mitigation and some comfort in one kind or other, which
          <span class="quote">if it had not been so, I should utterly have fainted</span>.
         
              But the merciful Jesus was so gracious to me as
          to let me live through all my sorrows until that holy time
          of Christmas drew nigh that I might commemorate the
          coming of our dear redeemer in the flesh and have the
           happy means of salvation be brought to me (who was so
          greatly afflicted with grief for the loss of my dear husband
          and all other miseries fell upon me that I was not able
          to get out of my bed by the renewal of my slanders on that
        
           marriage of my dear child).
         
         
           Yet, behold the gracious Lord God gave me that
           comfortable enjoyment of his holy word preached, and prayers
          in the family and in petitions to God for my weak condition and
           sorrows, wanting spiritual refreshment. Nor could I have
          any until so happy to receive the benefit of the Holy Communion, which the Lord was pleased to grant to me at this 
            time; <span class="quote">for I thirsted after the waters of life</span>, nor could I, for
           my great wounding in body and soul, be able to go to church.
         
           But, behold the goodness of God to me, a weak creature,
          who desired to prepare my soul to receive Christ in what manner I
           could, when he condescended to come unto me in his Holy Sacrament and gave me thereby a supply of all those graces I stood need
           of: speaking peace to the <span class="quote">broken and contrite heart</span>; <span class="quote">saying unto me
          he was my salvation</span>; making me to rejoice in his holy promise
           in my coming unto him, all yea that are weary and heavy laden.
      
         
              So came I to his holy majesty as to a fountain of living
               

            
           waters in the prophet Isaiah 57:157: <span class="quote">Ho, ye that thirst, come yea to 
          buy wine and milk without price</span>, <span class="quote">let your soul delight itself with
        
           fatness</span>. Lord, I am sick and wounded, hungry and faint, and no
          strength is left in me by reason of my sins.
         
           Oh, whither should I go to find ease, health, pardon (Romans
          8:
             1); strength (1 Corinthians 15); purity (Hebrews 9:14); peace (Romans 5:9); heaven 
           (Hebrews 10:19)? Christ chose bread and wine to be the outward signs of his
           body and fixed grace to what he chose (Luke 22:19). The papists calls it —
           the Sacrament — his real flesh; some protestants look upon it with good
           thoughts, but the papists adore the creature. But the Lord hath commanded:
          <span class="quote">Take, eat this in remembrance of me</span>. It is Christ's body only to those who
          receive him spiritually by faith, and of old in the church none suffered to look
          of the Sacrament but those that received it,

         nor ought any indeed to look upon the elements with unhallowed
           eyes (and hands and hearts not cleansed by the waters of true and unfeigned
          repentance).
          
           Christ is really and truly, not corporeally, present to our
             faith, and by faith so must apprehend him. And so, we must look
            (as in Exodus 12:26-27) as the paschal lamb, who signified the
          death of our saviour to the Jews, so doth these signs of bread and
          wine signify and set out to us the death and sufferings of our saviour
          for us Christians. These are figures to lift up our minds to
           set out Christ's death to God, the world and ourselves —
      
         
            <span class="quote">Christ, being wounded, and his bloodshed for our sins — and to
            beg pardon for us to God of which we must be mindful and eat,
           and feed on him by faith and thanksgiving and gratitude</span>.
         
              While my mouth is eating the blessed bread, thy soul is
           feeding by faith and apprehending its needs of Christ and his graces,
          and what Christ hath done for us. It believes in him, it hopes
           in him,
            and flies to him for refuge, and relies only on Christ and
           his merits for pardon, healing, strength against sin, the world
          and the devil. And thus is Christ received by every true believer.
               

         
          
           Christ chose outward signs signifying our needs as Psalm 104:
             15: <span class="quote">bread to strengthen man's heart and wine to make him a cheerful
               countenance</span>: experience teacheth these things are useful to our
          bodies. A Christian soul needs two things: strength against
           sin to overcome it and comfort, through Christ's power, against
          all temptations, being weary of duty, overcome by temptation
          is apt to stand still and not to go on in our earthly progress.
      
         
           (Matthew 11:28.)
         
           But oh, what joy it is to a sanctified soul to have Christ
          given
               
           thus to our souls, <span class="quote">who will by his death free us from all sin
          and reconcile us unto God</span>, and in the end of our weary progress
           present us unto God the Father, <span class="quote">who so loved the world that he
          gave his only begotten son to redeem us from hell and the power
           of the devil</span>. To the only wise, powerful and glorious Trinity
           is all glory, power, praise and dominion for this, his inexpressible

               

            
           mercy to mankind, but more especially to me, his poor, distressed
           <span class="quote">handmaid of the Lord</span>, who humbly begs the grace of this means
          to be on me, as well as the grace of the means and strengths to overcome all evils in soul and body. Amen.
         
              Having been thus blessed by God to have the Holy Sacrament
           brought to my house in my great weakness, which I so longed after,
           I found much comfort in my spirit, and was hopeful I should,
           by his grace, be enabled to go through this wilderness of sorrows
          when I considered that my saviour had suffered so much for
           me and suffered more than I could endure for him.

           There was many occurrences happened to me of a fresh supply of
           trials before I could be enabled to get by my sorrowful bed,
          which was of many occasions, <span class="event" id="ev159-start">but since it pleased God to give
           me this opportunity to receive the blessed Sacrament — with my
             daughter Comber and my son, and Hannah and some of hers — I was
           much comforted in God's mercy. This being the first time I could
          be able to do it since my dear husband's death which was in
           my chamber when I sat in bed, December 20th, 1668.
           </span>

         
              After which I was compelled to enter into bond for several
          sums of money to some that took my own single bond to pay
          those debts and funerals which was imposed upon me.

         
           <span class="event" id="ev161-start">
              It pleased God about January to enable me to get out of my
           bed, though very weak, yet by his great mercy, who gave me being
           and preserved me with life, did enable me to do it (though much fainting
           and sickness did affect me still).</span> But I received comfortable letters from
          my dear aunt and others, which did much ease my thoughts that 
          any was so charitable to regard my sad condition and blessed God
          for his gracious hand upon me.
      

         
           About this time also, I had a new affliction befell to me
           concerning <span class="event" id="ev162-start">my brother, Sir Christopher Wandesford, who, as I said
           before, had made over a rentcharge of £200  per annum
          to Mr Thornton out of Ireland to discharge my £1000  due for part
           of my portion (which Mr Thornton had, before marriage, given bond to
           secure for myself and children, and that I should enjoy it for my
          life if I was a widow and after my decease

               

            to be for my children).
         
         
              The other £100  a year was to repay Mr Thornton for that
          debt he paid to Mr Nettleton, which should have had it out of my
            father's estate in Ireland, and these conditions made when Mr Thornton did
          part with that estate to Sir Christopher Wandesford.
      </span>
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev163-start">
         
              When this rentcharge was demanded by Mr Thornton's
            friends (videlicet, Mr Portington and Mr Raines) to whom Mr Thornton
            had made a mortgage of 99 years over Leysthorpe (as I mentioned,
            upon the cutting off the entail of Mr Covill's entail on my two
           children, Alice and Katherine, to secure their portions and maintenance out of Leysthorpe). The cutting of the same, when I came to the hearing
           thereof in the year 1666, did bring

               
             me to that miscarriage by grief
            and brought me near to death, 
         
            which was made by a second deed of provision for a second wife
          and her children, for the securing this mortgage of £1600  and to raise
          £800  for the younger brothers and sisters of Mr Thornton, in case my
            husband should die without issue male</span> (which he did not, for God
           had blessed me with a delicate, lovely son: my son, Robert, who was 
           six years old at his father's death).
         

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.164&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 164</a>






            

         
           Yet,  this Leysthorpe was thus stated then and under these burdens,
          which was more than the land was worth or ever could pay.
           Where then was any provision left for my two daughters if
           I should have died, or anything to maintain them?
      
          
          
    <span class="event" id="ev164-start">
         
           Yet, upon Mr Thornton's decease, it was thought fit to
           secure this rentcharge of my portion and Nettleton's debt, which
           come to £2000, out of Sir Christopher Wandesford's estate.
          This rentcharge also must be made over by deeds to them
           (Mr Portington and Mr Raines) for the better security of their two
           mortgages, besides all Leysthorpe was made to them.
      
         
           And by which money, of Sir Christopher Wandesford for the rentcharge
           out of Ireland, was the mortgages paid in process of time,
          which could never

               
             have been done out of Leysthorpe but by the sale
           of it. And so have extirpated that estate from the family, and none
           of my poor children ever owned anything out of their
             father's estate if not redeemed thus by my right.
         
           But my brother, Sir Christopher Wandesford, knowing this £1000 
            in Ireland was my portion and that it was made over to me
          by Mr Thornton before marriage, would not pay any part of that rentcharge to the administrator of Mr Thornton but only to myself, being my due and right to have enjoyed now in my widowed
          estate according to articles and bond before marriage.
      
         
           I was forced to inform him that for that end — that Mr
                Thornton should settle Leysthorpe by Covill's deed upon my daughters
          for provision for portions and maintenance his debts being so
           great — that to pay them and free his land, I was willing to yield
           up that £1000  to clear his estate and make provision for his two children.
          And so I was to have no part in it, but desired it might
          be paid by him as the £1000  he paid to Nettleton was to go to the
        satisfaction of Mr Thornton's debts.
      </span>
          
         
           (When, in the meantime, still this heavy mortgage laid upon
           the estate of Leysthorpe and nothing, in reality, formally settled upon any
          of my children, nor anything in the world to maintain my
            dear and only son — then but six years old — and all swallowed up
          with debts from us. Nor had I ever one penny of all my father's
          portion to do me good in all my life nor my children:
           these was pinching circumstances for me to begin my life with.) 
      
         
           Yet, although I was thus willing to rob myself of my right
           and comfortable subsistence for myself and poor son, who I had
           undertaken to maintain and educate without any assistance,
          but to enter into debt the first hour of my widowhood.

         And had then a certain and great debt due to my own
           self by virtue of my honoured father's last will and testament and
           my dear mother's. In the first place, there was a great sum
          of money due from thence for my own maintenance and
          education since my father's death after £80  per annum
           for 12 years. Also, the sum of £6000   fell due to me
           by the death of my dear brother, George Wandesford, who
          was heir.
         
           The estate fell upon Sir Christopher Wandesford, as next heir, and
           <span class="event" id="evn15-start">his £3000  was due to my brother, John Wandesford, his younger brother;</span>
           and he, dying without issue, the same £6000  fell due to me as his
           next right (as, being his executrix, being personal estate).
          
    <span class="event" id="ev165-start">
         
           But the greatest and most easy to have been obtained —
          and which I had the greatest injury done by
           not obtaining it — was that
           of my dear mother's jointure and annuity of £300  per annum
           in Ireland (charged overall both by deed of annuity of it to be
            first paid out of that land of Idough, and also charged by my
            honoured
              father's last will and testament).
         
         
           Due for 19 years after his death, of which she never received
           one penny, though Sir John Lowther offered her (in my hearing) £1500 
           if she would resign her right to his son, Christopher, in it. But she,
          hoping Mr Thornton would reap the benefit according to her true intent
          to do justly to pay the debt of Sir Edward Osborne for my brother George

       
           his wardship, she made a deed to feoffees in trust for that purpose
           to pay that debt out of it. And all the rest of her arrears that she

had settled for my use and my children to receive and lay
           out the remainder of those arrears (being £7000)  to purchase land
          of inheritance for me and my poor children.</span>
          
         
           Yet, nothing of this would be taken into consideration, either
           by one or the other; either to demand the said dues for myself and children,
          or the other to give me in lieu of it.
         
              Albeit I stood upon it to have it demanded as my right and
           due, yet they was so cold in the matter that there was nothing
           done in it, in my behalf (lest of offending Sir Christopher, who was then to pay
           that annuity I should have had for debts).
      
         
           Although that was designed, so yet it would have been no
          disadvantage to debts of my children's welfare to have been
           better enabled to have performed all, if my rights had been gained
           to the satisfaction of my dear uncle Sir Edward Osborne's debt, which
        
           my dear mother gave first out of those arrears, which by remissness
           and neglect was quite lost. Nay, the gaining of the one would have


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.166&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 166</a>






            
         

              been the way and means to have got the other arrears due to
           me, and the neglect of the first was the loss of the whole arrears
          to the destruction of myself and estate.
          
    <span class="event" id="ev166-start">
         
           But, instead of my receiving any advantage from them,
        when Sir Christopher saw that my £1000 was thus condemned
          to the debts of Mr Thornton — and that his estate could not
           subsist without that annuity out of his estate due to me (as above) —
          he was very earnest to have me to make him a general
          release of all my rights and dues to me out of my father's
            estate, either by myself or mother or my brother, John Wandesford,
          which he very well knew was a very great sum of money.
      
         
              And before he would yield to pay one penny of the annuity
          to Mr Thornton's administrator, he stood upon this point and
           would do nothing or pay any dues; so, having made his
           demand of these things (which I suppose was by the advice of his
             father-in-law, who knew I had never released my rights or
           my mother's out of that estate, but kept this as a rod over us
          to make me yield to these unjust demands knowing how
           low my husband's estate was judged) we could not obtain it
          by course of law or have any right from him.
         
              This sad oppression was very grievous over my weak
           spirits, who had none in the world to take my part or to assist
          me to get my dues; nor was it judged fit to advise with my
          dear uncle Sir Edward Osborne's relations about this concern
           — which so much concerned them — lest the acting in that might be to
        
        hinder the payment of the annuity for Mr Thornton's debts.
      
         
           But, alas, I was left into a deep distress and great
          dilemma what to do or which way to take for deliverance out of
          this labyrinth. I had none to fly unto for redress but to
           the God of mercies, who is a fountain of infinite mercy
           to all those which rely upon his providence and defence. To him, alone,
          did I appeal for succour
               
           and relief to bring me out these straits,
          and for deliverance out of all my distress.
         
              For the sad apprehension of those evils fallen on me and
           fears of greater to come, with the unkindness of my own brother,
           who had ever been a loving brother to me, yet now to make
          use of my weak estate to wrong me of my just rights by my
            dear father's and mother's will, which I ought to have had and to
          which I stood in such need of. These troubles added to all
           my former afflictions, renewed my griefs and my


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.167&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 167</a>






            sickness, my faintings and watchings in the nights, for
           want of sleep, did bring great weakness and afflictions of
          spirits disabling me to act in my worldly and great affairs.</span>
          
         
           But, even in the midst of all my sorrows, with holy David,
           will I lift up my heart and say. Lordc thou has comforted
           me; <span class="quote">yea, when my father and mother by death forsaketh me;
           yea</span>, all my friends forsaketh me for this worldly advantages,
           thou, Lord, takes care of me and taketh me up.
         
           So, O Lord, do thou still uphold me from sinking under this
           temporal affliction and make me <span class="quote">to put my trust in thee</span>.
           Turn the hearts of these my friends, O thou, that makest men to be
           of one mind in a house, make them to be comforts and not sorrows
           to me, thy faithful handmaid and sorrowful widow, for my
           Lord and saviour Jesus, his sake. Amen.
          
    <span class="event" id="ev167-start">
         
              When my son Comber saw me in such distress and concern that I should destroy myself and children of all my
          dues from that estate from Sir Christopher, he told me I might
          have some advice what to do in the case from some lawyer which
        
        could assist me in that point, which I was glad to do.
         
           For though, at present, no likelihood Sir Christopher Wandesford
          would agree or pay any of the rentcharge without suit, or 
          to make me sign such a base release as was drawn up by
           Mr Binlowes (a turncoat, bitter presbyterian, Sir Christopher made use
           of)
           which cut me totally off, or any of mine, from ever having any
          benefit of my father's will by which I had very great dues.
           Yet, I would not do it or sign any at all until I had some
          advice about it.
         
              For I was greatly concerned to consider what a poor and
           low condition this estate was in by debts, which was too much
          contracted by Sir Christopher Wandesford's obstinacy against my husband for that
        
        unfortunate taking the assignment of the Irish estate on him.
         
              Yet was I more willing to suffer loss in my own private
           estate, if possible I might wade through it, provided that I
           might be advised how to secure — out of my love to my dear
             son and the family — those rights and dues I had from my father's
           estate, if I could have it secured to my poor son and family.
          
          
    
         
           To this end, I advised with Mr Hassell, an able lawyer, about
          this business who did draw up a deed of gift for me to seal
           and sign, in a legal manner, to feoffees in trust

         of all my rights, dues and titles to what my honoured father and
           mother had given me by and in their last wills and testaments;
            references being thereunto had (as may at large) appear in
           all their deeds, and gifts and bequeaths belonging to myself, or
           mother or brother.
          
           And to settle them all (upon the feoffees
           in trust) for the use and behoof of my only son and heir, to
           him and his issue and, for default of such issue, then to the use
           and behoof of my two daughters, Alice and Katherine
             Thornton, to them and their heirs forever, 
         
               to be laid out in land of inheritance, purchased for them
          as near as could be obtained to be near unto my husband's
           estate of East Newton and Leysthorpe. And yet, nevertheless,
          reserving power in myself: a power of revocation.
           The trustees nominated: Ranald Graham, esquire,
           Dr Watkinson, master chancellor of York, and Dr Burton.
      
         
              This deed of trust, or gift of mine was dated,
             in the
            
            
        before the release was signed by me to Sir Christopher Wandesford
           which was drawn up by my counsel's advice, Mr Driffield.
          Nor would I do it to rob myself
        of every bequeath which my
          dear father and mother had out of their tender affection
          given to me, but would have that only reserved to myself
           of £100, given by my dear father in his
           will to my dear mother to buy her a jewel.
         
           Which Sir Christopher, or some for him, thought much at that I
           should not be a cast out or exposed from that family in all but,
           with much to do, I did afterwards receive the same £100.
         
         

           
           £50 of which I received and paid my Lady Yorke that
          £50  I borrowed of her, and the other £50  was paid by me for
           the discharge of some debt of my son Thornton at Cambridge.
          But I humbly bless Almighty God for this great mercy that
          I received in this £100  which relieved myself and poor son. 
         
              The release of mine to Sir Christopher Wandesford was dated –
         </span>
         
              
          
       </p>
      <p id="div-020">
         
              Thus was I stripped of all the great riches and honourable enjoyments
          I had right unto which I yielded to do for the good and quiet of
           this family being unable in body — or purse — to resist this great
           pressure was laid for me, which proved the overthrow of this poor estate.

           Which, if it might have been rightly managed in my husband's
           lifetime, or since his death, by some friend or assistance to have
           succoured me in my distress, it would have been so great an
          advantage to have purchased a double estate to what I found
           and made a most flourishing family as was in this country.
      
         
           But, since I am now reduced to this degree of loss in those
          riches which God had given me, I humbly beg his grace and
          patience to be supported under the hand of God, which he did
          see fit to bring me to under great burdens and debts and losses which I no
           ways was contributory to: either by my pride, extravagancy,
          voluptuousness; excess or wastefulness of what the Lord had
           given me; nor by any way of imprudence to that managery
           of what was under my care, or part to perform in my power.
         
              I hope that God and my own conscience will not condemn
           me for any of these things since what I did do (in point
          of housekeeping, diet, apparel or entertainments) was
           ever designed and practised to keep within bounds of moderation,
          decency and necessity. Nor ever I affected to conform myself to the modes or quirks of new fashions and affected novelties, either in meat, drink, apparel of the gaieties of the world,
           not even in the prime of my youth when, as Job sayeth, the<span class="quote">
        candle of the Lord shined upon me</span>.
         
              But I bless God for his grace to me in giving me to
           strive and endeavour after the adorning of my spirit and 
        [heart]
    ,
            with all those <span class="quote">Christian virtues of faith, humility, patience
          meekness, chastity and charity</span>; that <span class="quote">I might put on the Lord
          Jesus Christ and him crucified</span>; that by following of him in his
           steps, I might become acceptable in his eyes and abounding
           in true and faithful, conjugal love to my husband and his family.
         
           I cannot deny <span class="event" id="ev169-start">but when my dear and only sister's family,
           some of them, fell into decay and the estate taken away by the late
          rebellion against King Charles I and so exposed to much
           poverty, especially the second son who married against his father's command,
           and came to be a family miserable enough. To relieve himself and family,
           I did expend out of my dear mother's estate, she gave me some
          considerable sums to relieve that family but not without my husband's knowledge or consent, who never was backward in those
          points of charity.</span>
      
         
           And if, in this point I have erred, I humbly beg pardon since
          affection, necessity and charity obliged my assistance in their cases.

         And if now, I am reduced to want those necessaries I bestowed
           on them, and their estates be now flourishing, and mine 
          brought down to want and indigency by great and many debts
           contracted by others, and for the saving the estate I am now
          so low, I will not yet despair in the mighty help and
          relief of a mighty and merciful Father of heaven, 
         
            who both sees my distress and, I hope, will pity my condition.
            And though he has raised three families by my means and my
          friends to great riches and glory in the world and given me
          to <span class="quote">taste of his bitter cup of sufferings</span> for others.
         
              Yet will I humbly cast myself low before his
           footstool and <span class="quote">throne of grace</span>, who has <span class="quote">brought me down to
           the grave and raised me up times without number</span>. He alone
           both can and, I hope, will raise me out of this poor estate
          and give me sufficient sustentation, support, relief and
           deliverance out of this land of bondage.
      
         
              Even as his mercy did to that poor widow of
          <span class="quote">Zarephath</span>, and give me out of that little I have to pay all
          debts, pay all just dues, to live in a moderate comfortable
          station; not being burdensome to any but <span class="quote">doing good to
            all</span>; <span class="quote">harm to none, being helpful, useful, charitable
          to those in need or necessity and to follow after St Paul's
          rule</span>. In this, I exercise myself: to keep a conscience 
          void of offence, both towards God and towards man, 
         
               that so I may ever live in the fear of God, die
           in his favour and forever rest in his glory. And this I
           humbly beg in the name and for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ;
           therefore, I say, amen, so be it, Lord.
      
         
           Although we had gone this way, and taken the method
           already mentioned, to satisfy my friends of the reasons and
          necessities of this family to have the eldest daughter so
           disposed, and for my own great sickness and weakness on my great
           afflictions; yet, notwithstanding, all good people was satisfied
          with our proceedings in it.

           Yet, it seems Mrs Danby was still the same by her
          inveterate malice against Mr Comber and against the
        
        match. She could not let us alone but still employing new
           emissaries to stir up new <span class="evquote">coals of mischief</span> against us,

         Elizabeth Nicholson's ear, one who, though of the Romish faith,
          yet had the principles of charity so much that it wound her
          so much to hear such horrid lies and slanders raised by her
          against such which she knew had the grace of God in them.</span>
         

         
    
         
           Therefore, she writ a letter to me to acquaint me with it
           and also one to my brother Denton to desire him, as he had
           known all the intrigues of this family, so he would do
          as much to testify the same which would give a great satisfaction to all strangers ; for those of our knowledge was well satisfied, only who she had deceived by her cunning tongue.
         
         
    
         
           Which my brother Denton was pleased to do. And so,
           after little time, he did write to my cousin Nicholson in
           as full and satisfactory manner as could be to that end, and
          it did very much satisfy all who she saw cause to declare
           it to, to my great comfort and all concerned. 
         
         
            He, being so wise and prudent a person, was more
          prevalent in this concern since we acted nothing without
          his consent and approbation and judgement.
         
           But while this affair was in acting — and all my heavy
          pressures of debts and odious heartbreaking circumstances
          against that precious good name I esteemed above gold
          or all the riches in the world that afflictions lay so heavy on me
           (together with all the rest of my misery which Satan stirred
          up against me still to keep under despair and to sink that
            life yet in me by griefs and mournings, night and day) —
         
         
            in this deep distress of sorrows, I did much
          continue for several months together. But the greatest
           comfort I took was in the consideration of God's almighty
           power to bring me out of all, and was my support under it (in
          the testimony of a clear conscience) and while I was able to do
           my duty (what my poor ability was) in teaching my dear
          and only son to read and hear him his catechisms, prayers and
          psalms, getting proverbs by heart and many such like duties.

           But one day above all the rest, being, as I remember,
           on my own birthday in the afternoon, having kept the other
           part separate in fasting and prayer (February 13th, 1668),

           as I was sitting on the longsettle in my chamber, and hearing read in 
          the gospel of St Matthew, my heart was full of sorrow and bitterness of spirit, being overwhelmed with all sorts of afflictions
           that lay upon me; considering my poor condition either to
           pay debts to maintain this poor, young child or to give
           him that education which I would and designed by God's blessing to
          bring him up a clergy man and a true minister of the gospel
           (<span class="evquote">according to my vow and promise made to God, when I begged
          him of God in obedience to my dear husband's longing desire
           to have a son to heir this ancient house and family</span>).
         
              And now God granted that request in giving me a
          son and one blessed with great hopes of promising parts
          and apt to learn all good things taught him, yet such
          was my low and mean estate reduced to that I wanted
           a sufficient supply out of my own jointure (being but
           very little made of it by those tenants) either to
           maintain him or myself, and great debts, public charity
           and unavoidable payments out of it. 
         
              All which considerations came on my thoughts together did overflow my weak spirits at that time. And how
           I should ever be able to subsist or ever bring him up,
           according to my promise and vow made to my God,
          in which I was almost drove to despair in myself that
           God, who was so gracious to all and had been so to me,
      
         
              yet such was his great displeasure against me that
          he seemed to afflict me more than any, with all his heavy
           arrows at once: both in body, spirit and estate by the
          loss of my dear husband, my <span class="evquote">good name</span>, my goods and
           all other heavy pressures upon me, and taken away most
           of my friends that might have supported me.
         
              All which did so oppress my heart and did persuade
          me that <span class="evquote">God had forsaken me and cast
             me out of his sight</span>
          and that I could no way find any comfort, since <span class="evquote">I feared
           the Lord had cast me off forever</span>.
         
              The deep reflection which wounded most was that I had
           deserved justly at God's hand to be cast off <span class="evquote">because I had
             matched into a contrary faith and opinion to my own</span>
           and, therefore, I was thus sadly followed by sufferings. And
           also, if I should be taken from my children, knew not into
           what hand they might light into, though God knew
             what I had


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.173&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 173</a>






         suffered and endeavoured to secure my faith to God and the
           children he gave me (and that this was a great motive to
           me to match my child, so as to establish his faith in my
           family and in the right principling them in religion).
      
         
              But such was my sad affliction at this time that
           passion and a flood of tears overcame my reason and religion,
          and made me to leave my dear child when I was teaching him to read. And could not contain my great and infinite sorrows, but scarce got to my bedside for falling down,
           when I then cast myself cross the beds, fell in bitter weeping
          and extreme passion for offending God or provoking his wrath
          against me to leave and forsake me thus forlorn.
         
           But, while I was in this desperate condition and full
          of despair in myself, behold the miraculous goodness of
          God, even that God who I apprehended had forsaken me and
          cast me off forever, in that very instant of time did
          bring me an unexpected both relief and comfort, though a mixture of his gentle reproof for my too great passion and impatiency under his hand of correction.
         
           My dear son, Robert, seeing me fallen down on the
        bed in such a sad condition and bitter weeping, comes to me to the
           bedside, and being deeply concerned to see me in such extremity,
           crept on the bed with his poor hands and knees, and cast himself on
           my breast. And embracing me in his arms and laid his cheek
           to mine, with abundance of tears,
         
            cried out to me in these words: 'Oh, my dear, sweet
          mother! What is the reason that you do weep and lament
          and mourn so much and ready to break your heart? Is it
          for my father that you do mourn for so much?'
         
           To which I answered: 'Ah, my dear child, it is for the loss
           of thy dear father. Have I not cause? For I am this day <span class="evquote">a
          desolate widow</span> left, and thou art a poor young orphan
           without help or any relief'. To which my dear infant answered:
         
            'Do you not, my dear mother, believe that my father
          is gone to heaven?'
         
           To which I replied again: 'Yes, I do believe and hope through
           Christ's merits and sufferings for us that thy dear father is gone
           to heaven'.
         
           Upon which, he said to me again: 'And would you
          have my father to come out of heaven, where he enjoys
           God and all joy and happiness, to come down out of heaven and
          endure all those sicknesses and sorrows (he did to comfort you) here?

         <span class="evquote">Who is the Father of the fatherless</span>, and husband to the
           widow? Is not God? Will not he provide for you? Oh, my
          dear mother, do not weep and lament thus very
           sore; for if I live, I will take care for you and comfort
           you, but if you weep thus and mourn, 
         
               you will break my heart and then all is gone.
           Therefore, my dear mother, be comforted in God and he will
           preserve you'. All which words — uttered with so great a compassion,
          affection and filial dearness and tenderness — can never be forgot
          by me, but this excellent counsel came from God and not
           from man: for none but the spirit of God could put such words
           into the mouth of a child but six years old and four months.
         
           Therefore, I acknowledge the glory to my gracious God
           in it, which both did admonish my passion and put this 
           comfortable word into his mouth, which I bless the Lord my God
          for and never after was overcome with the like passion.</span>
         
         
              <span class="quote">Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings has thou
           ordained strength</span>; therefore, will I magnify thy holy name,
           O Lord, forever which thus found out a way — from <span class="quote">the child of
             my own bowels</span>, and so young and untainted with the follies of sin —
           to remember his holy word to be my comfort and thus, from time
           to time, have I been upheld from sinking into despair.
      
         
           Blessed be the Lord God of his people, who hath not now
          forsaken me quite but helped me in this distress and made me
           to remember, by this child's mouth, that he is the God <span class="quote">of the
           fatherless and widows</span> and will <span class="quote">not forsake those that trust in him</span>.

              I was at another time comforted from the mouth of this
                child when he was very young, and I have great cause to recount
           the goodness of God to me and him to put his spirit so early into him.
         
           When his sister Kate had the smallpox, he was with me in the
        
           scarlet chamber and, looking very earnestly to the window with his eyes
          up to heaven in a deep meditation, with a great sigh said to

           'Mother, God is a most holy, righteous and pure spirit. 
         
               The devil is a lying, wicked and evil spirit.
           It is better to serve this holy, pure God and righteous spirit
           than to serve this lying, wicked spirit, the devil.
           And by God's grace, I will love and
               
             serve this good God

           

         and not this evil spirit, which is the devil', which he spoke with a great

           deal of zeal and earnestness of speech, and from his poor
          heart, which was a great deal of comfort to me and blessed God for 
           his grace put into him, my child, and bid him follow these good things,

           The first time he went to church at Stonegrave, he was
           but four years old and a half or thereabouts. Mr Comber preached
          but I was not well and could not go to church but he went with
           his father. And after he came home, I asked him what he did
           remember of the sermon and where was the text; for if he did
           not remember to tell me the text and sermon, he should go no more,
          not to be idle and look about him but to hear and remember what
        
        God said to him by his ministers.
         
           After this, he looked me in my face and cried out: 'Oh mother,
          God did tell me in the text that he loved me with an everlasting
          love and his loving kindness he did embrace me, and he would
           never leave me nor forsake me. And indeed, I love God with all my
           
        [heart]
    '.
         
         
              At which unexpected answer of this infant, my heart
          was exceeding joyful because he spoke it with so much zeal 
           and joy in his poor, weak heart and did often remember it
           (many great expressions of fear and love to God as he was able to
           express) which I humbly and gratefully remember to the praise of the Lord,
           my God of heaven, for what he had done to my dear child which did
           give me hopes that he had consigned him for his service (as I
           humbly gave him before he was in my womb).

              Long before this time, Mr Thornton being in my chamber
           and my dear child on his knee, being very young, his father
          began to tell him that <span class="evquote">God made man of the dust of the earth</span>
           and <span class="evquote">gave him a body and soul and made him Eve to be his wife</span>,
           and gave her to Adam. <span class="evquote">And had made all the creatures in the world
             for Adam and Eve's service</span>, and made a garden and gave them all the 
          trees of the garden for fruit, only one tree which God had forbidden
           them to eat of it which was an apple tree. And said that, if they did
           eat of the apple tree, they should die and charged them not to eat
           of it: if they did that they should die.
      
         
           <span class="evquote">But the devil, in a shape of a serpent, beguiled
               
             Eve and
           tempted her to eat of an apple, and so God was angry at her and
             Adam. They both did eat of it and so he cursed them, and said
             they should die because of disobeying his commands. And so death came
          into the world and all we must die for this sin</span>.

           The child, beholding his father very earnestly and looked him 
            upon
               
           his face, cried out to his father, 'Oh Father', and must 
           he die too? He, with a great passion of tears, said must he die
           for eating God's apple? He was sure he did not eat God's
           apple and must he die, with abundance of sorrow and bitterness, as
          if he had really seen this with his eyes?
      
         
           Which his father took hold of him, and said that though he did
           not eat it himself but in his <span class="evquote">first parents, Adam and Eve</span> — we, being
          their children — yet <span class="evquote">God was so merciful to mankind that
           he did give his only son, Jesus Christ, to die for us, as it was 
           in his belief, he was crucified for us that, if we believe in him, we
          shall be saved and fear and serve God all our days</span>.
      
         
           To which the poor infant said, 'I believe in God and in
           Jesus Christ who died for me and will love and fear him all my 
           life', with many great expressions of piety.</span>
         
         
           <span class="quote">Oh, who gives man knowledge</span>? <span class="quote">Is it not I, saith the Lord,

           from the mouth of my son, Robert, after his father's death, in

           Jeremiah 54th chapter, and from the fourth verse to the ninth.

       About March 25, 1669, I was writing of my 'First Book of My Life'
         to enter the sad sicknesses and death of my dear husband together
       with all those afflictions befell me that year, with the remarks of 
         God's dealing with myself, husband and children until my widowed
         condition, as I had done ever since I could remember from my
          first youth and childhood. There happened me then a very strange
         and dangerous accident to me, casually, which might have been of
          a dangerous consequence to the sight of my left eye, if not to have
          influenced upon both and have put them out. 
      
         
            which shows we are ever in danger and never free from the worst of
          casualties without the watchful eye of divine providence to guard
          both our souls and bodies from the hostility of the devil; even when we
           may think ourselves most safe and free from harm, in an innocent
           or religious employment, then doth our enemy watch to do us evil.
      
         
           The occasion was thus, which had like to have been so fatal
           to me. There was a poor little creature, harmless in itself, and without
          any gall or malice to do hurt.

          A little young chicken (not above 14 days old) which had been exposed
            and picked out of hen's nest that hatched it, and by her was turned out 
            from amongst the flock she had newly hatched (being about nine in
            number, all which she brooked and made much of, but this poor chick
            she had turned out of the nest). In a morning, when the maid came to
            see if she was hatched, and finding this poor chicken cast out
          of the nest on the ground and for dead and cold. But the maid took
          it up and put it under the hen to have recruited it by warmth.
         
              But the hen was so wild and mad at it that she would not
           let it be with her or come near her, but picked it, and bit it and
           scratched it out with her feet twice or thrice when the maid put it in;
           so that she see no hopes of the hen to nurse it up as the rest, so
          she took it up and put it in her breast to recover it.
      
         
           And so, she brought this poor creature to me and told me all
          this story with great indignation against the unnaturalness of
           its mother. But I, pitying
               
           this forlorn creature in that case, could
           not withhold my care to see if I could any way save the life of it,
          and carried it to the fire, lapped
             it in wool, and got some cordial
           waters and opened its bill, and put a drop by little and little, and then it gasped
           and came to life within an hour (giving it warm milk until it was recovered)
           and became a fine pert chicken.
      
         
           Thus, I saved it and recovered it again, making much of it and was
           very fond of it, having recovered it to life, and kept it in a basket with 
          wool in the nights and in my pocket in the days until it came to be
          a very pretty coloured and a strong bird, about 14 or 16 days old.
           And sometimes put it in to my bosom to nourish and bring it up (hoping
          it had been a hen chick and then I fancied it might have brought
           me eggs in time and so got a breed of it). This was my innocent
          diversion in my melancholy hours.
         
           Until one day, about Candlemas, 1669,
               
               having begun a
          Book, wherein I had entered very many and great remarks
          of my course of life what God had done for me since my
          childhood, in my youth and younger years until continued
           to my married estate. And for my husband, relations
           and children having writ down most remarks of my
          life, which observations of mercies, deliverances and thanksgivings
           thereupon, until I came to the later part, which concerned my
           loss of my dear husband. And was, at that time, entering
          my fatal loss and the passages of his sickness with other occurrences
          befell me before and after his death.
      
         
           And as I was writing in my said Book, I took out this
          poor chicken out of my pocket to feed it with bread and set it on


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.180&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 180</a>






            
           

           the table besides me. It, picking about the bread innocently, did
          peep up at my left eye. Whether it thought the white of my
           eye had been some bread — while I was attent on my Book in
           writing, held my head and eye down, not suspecting any
           hurt or fearing any evil accident — this poor, little bird
          picked one pick at the white of my left eye as I looked
           downward, which did so extremely smart and ache that
          I could not look up or see of either of my eyes.
         
              And the pain and bloodshot of it grew up into a little
           knot and lump, with the hurt and bruise in that tender part, that
        
        I was sore swelled and bloodshot that it took away the sight
           of it for a long time and had a skin and pearl of it.
           And which pain and sickness brought me to my bed, and I could not
           see almost anything of it and endangered the sight of both.
         
           This was a great misfortune which happened then, and like
           to have proved fatal if I had lost my precious sight by it
           and, notwithstanding all the means I could use, was very
          extreme on me by pains and anguish it brought on me; nor
          could I eat, or sleep or be at ease for 14 days until it did
          please God to mitigate my sorrows and gave me ease by what
           I used to it.
      
          
           Thus, had I cause to call upon my gracious God and
           Father of heaven, who had permitted so great an evil to
           come upon me to wound that part, which I had so great a
           cause to make use of by tears and sorrow in this my troubled
           and sad condition. But since I suffered by a poor creature,
           who had no gall or malice to me but in its being mistaken,
          I could have no resent against that creature but endeavoured to
           take my pains with patience; since I had deserved from God to
           have lost my sight from him that gave it, and was at this time
          dealt with abundance of mercy in all the passages of his providence
          who had given me speedy help. 

               

         
         
            He did, in great mercy, preserve my right eye and at 
           length restored my sight, about six weeks or more that I had
          suffered by it, nor could I suffer this poor creature to be killed
           (as I was put upon for this) for it did in its innocency.
         
              There was some who jested with me and said they had heard of
          an old saying of bringing up a chicken to peck out their eye.
             But
           now they saw I had made good that old saying, both in this bird

           and what harm I had suffered from Mrs Danby, of whom I
           had been so careful and preserved her and hers from starving.
      
         
           But I told them that her crime was more unpardonable;
          for what was done by her was out of malice and unmerited from 
          me, and what I did for hers and her was out of my Christian
        
           charity and God's cause, and only of pity I saved the dying
          chicken.
           </span>
          
          
           But I humbly bless God for all my deliverances,
          both from the death of my good name and my body and my
           soul, which was aimed at by my spiritual and worldly
          enemies, and also praise his holy name for the deliverance
           of my bodily eyes (so precious and useful a mercy) which
        was the great comfort of my soul and body by which I may
           see to read my duty in the word of God, to pray and to
          <span class="quote">meditate in his law both day and night</span>, 
         
               and to walk in his ways and bring up my poor
                children and do my duty in that estate of life unto the which
        it pleased God to call me.
         
           Oh, what shall I render to the most high <span class="quote">God of heaven
             and earth</span>, who has looked upon my affliction in this thing
          and showed his infinite mercy on me <span class="quote">as he did to the two
          blind men in the gospel whom he cursed with a touch of his
           hand</span>? Lord, <span class="quote">heal my soul</span> from all the deadly darts of
           the devil and cure me from spiritual blindness, as thou hast
           done my bodily eyes that, by the help of thy Holy Spirit,
          I may find out the way to the true light which thou givest
           to all those that truly love and fear thee.
      
         
           Oh, grant that I may so <span class="quote">run the race that is set before
          me</span> that <span class="quote">I may run and not be weary, walk and not be faint</span>
          until I arrive at the land of everlasting rest. And this I humbly beg for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ  and that for his merits,
           take, grant my humble petitions. Amen.
          
           Thus, have I new occasion upon every action of my life
          to bless and praise the Lord my God, who hath so watchful
          an eye over me; for if this chicken had light with its bill on the
        
        sight, or black of my eye, it had infallibly put it out and
           much endangered the other eye too (there being so great a sympathy
           betwixt them in the optics). Therefore, will I praise and glorify the
           God of mercy for both and humbly beseech him that with these very eyes,
           as Job saith, <span class="quote">I may see God: not another for me</span>, but with these eyes

           do I hope and long for to see God, my Creator and Father of Heaven
           and Jesus Christ, the redeemer, and my saviour and deliverer;
           and the Holy Spirit, the sanctifier of all the elect people
               

            
           of God; and thou, O holy, blessed and glorious Lord. To the glorious Trinity
           be forever given by me, and all my posterity <span class="quote">all honour
           and glory, power, might and dominion, and praise</span> <span class="quote">ascribed

              It was not long after this visitation that I had
          the great trial of grief on me about the release I was
           compelled to give my brother, Sir Christopher Wandesford, of all my
           dues and rights to my dear father's and mother's will, which
           did not a little aggravate my sorrows but, having spoke
           of this in another place, do forebear any repetition,
          still having new fuel put to the first flame of my
          sorrows which was not extinct but laid sleeping a little
          until fresh occasions from without kindled a new flame.
      </span>
          
         
              All this time I had great payments demanded for
           debts and for the funerals, and maintenance of my two children,
          my family having received but small sums both
           from England and Ireland to pay Mr Portington and Mr
          Raines their rentcharge

             and all interest. And when that
            
           failed, I was forced to make up payments for it and other
           things out of my own purse or out of Leysthorpe, which was
           designed out for the children's (two daughters) maintenance.

         
           My eldest daughter being married, her maintenance
          ceased as such and was paid to her according to the settlement
          for interest of her portion; so that land and rents did not
           make out the due I should have had for maintenance,
          but came so short everylike
             and for several years received
           not 20 shillings a year to her use (besides what was paid for interest
           and public charges).
      
         
              Insomuch as I was compelled to borrow money
           to maintain her with, as well as to maintain her brother,
          Robert, out of nothing allowed for him but my own and £20 
           I had not to borrow for it, so that — my estate small, income
          little, charges great and debts high — was prepared for me to
          live a most uncomfortable life. And all the comfort I had
          was only from the immense goodness of my God to grant
           me a miraculous support under his hand of corrections,

          and what I had from the love and affection of my dear
            children. And that now the help of several concerns of the
            estate, in which Mr Comber and Brother Denton did act —
          concerning the accounts with creditors and to procure monies to pay with and to get acquittances and discharges —
          which was indeed a kindness in my weak condition
      

         
              to assist me to strangers but the burden did lie
           upon my weak shoulders, bearing the weight and load
          of the debts until I could pay. But I give them many
          thanks for what assistance they gave me and bless God for
           it, owning any kindness done to the widow and fatherless,
           and in what I could, in gratitude, return to them, and what I
           cannot, I hope God Almighty will please to supply.

              About April, it pleased God my strength and sight
           began to recover, though still in a mournful condition. I
          was a great object of my dearest friends' pity and
          of my enemies' scorn, which yet by this time the world
          was convinced I was persecuted without a cause 
          but what proceeded from their own malice, which was set on
           work by the greater accuser of the brethren; as he,
           with his instruments, had begun the tragedy of my unspotted
           honour, so was he resolved to finish it. And being despair
          of prevailing against me by his temptations of all
          kinds to win my soul;
         
            so, was resolved to leave no stone unturned to
          use his utmost by his agents to make my life very
           uncomfortable by daily new stratagems to bring
           lying reports to the ears of strangers, by the tongues of
           Mrs Danby and her maid, to repeat and raise false calumnies
           to be revenged for being turned out of my house, and
          to wanting daily provision and maintenance from me

           But still, I must observe with great gratitude to
          my gracious <span class="quote">Father of mercy</span> that wherever the
          serpent began to hiss and stir up his venom in

           divine providence; so, ordering such circumstances of
           my friends, unknown to me, <span class="event" id="ev180-start">as no sooner my enemies began
          to broach their venom by their tongues but my friends
          are as ready to stop their first assault, which was given against
          me by Mrs Danby at Ripon, where there was several of my kind
           friends lived. As my cousin, Frances Maude, and her two sisters
        
           (my cousin Maude, Jane Wandesford married to Mr Ande,
           and my cousin Lister the youngest).
      
         
           At which time, my cousin Elizabeth Nicholson, which was niece
           to them all, being at Ripon and made acquainted by them
           what most vile aspersions Mrs Danby had invented, and others,
           against my son Comber, so that I was made a reproach by some —
           but not my friends — for marrying my daughter to him (being
          a clergyman) and which had come to my Lady Frankland's ears
          and my Lady Wyvill and others.
      
         
           But my dear cousin Nicholson, seeing that I had
          this mischief done and traduced
               
           in my best of my actions, had
          a great deal of concern for my wronged virtue and was
           desired by her aunts (as before) to acquaint me with those abuses
           my enemies put upon me. And desired that I would let them
           see my papers and letters which did concern that business,
          and the reasons and occasion which caused Mr Thornton and myself to match our daughter there.
      
         
              Together with all those letters of court from my son to
           her, with Mrs Danby's letter of advice to Mr Comber rather to
           choose her than Mr Holland's daughter, which at that time he
           had proposed at London with a living of £100  a year for him.
         
           And several letters to me — of his mother and himself — to
           desire my consent for her son to match with my daughter,
          with many other material circumstances convincing all
          that see them of the just grounds and candid
           
             reasons for us
          to consent to this motion.
         
              All which papers are very material to the purpose and true
           evidences of all our integrity and virtue, and convincing proofs
           of Mrs Danby's vileness and abominable treachery and falsehood
          to abuse such

               
           honest proceedings, after she had so solemnly
           protested to the contrary (to Mr Thornton and Mr Denton) she
          would never speak of such things after she was gone from
           Newton (which, if she had not done to clear herself, my dear husband
           did protest he would have punished her and her servant).
      
         
              These letters, papers and transaction of this affair are
           in bundles, and preserved to make out these proceedings and
          in vindication of our just and laudable actions,

           and for the good end, now spoken to satisfy all my friends
           or all good people, my cousin, Elizabeth Nicholson, desired me to send
           her those letters and papers aforesaid, which I did send to her to
           Ripon. And from thence she sent them, by my order and Daphne's
          desire to her, to show my friends at Richmond and to my
          Lady Wyvill
               
             who was much concerned for all my wrongs and
          pitied me extremely much.</span>

          
    
         
           The letter of account, which I received from my cousin Nicholson
           in answer to mine, was as follows. Dated: December 2nd, 1669.
          
         
             
              Most worthy cousin, I received your last and have performed
               your desire and sent your letters to Daphne by my cousin, Thomas Gill,
               who I met with at Ripon, where I have done you all the right
          I possibly could in making you appear by your prudence from
          time to time truly virtuous, and not so imprudent an act
          as it appeared to some in the matching of your daughter.
      
          
           And, in relating the truth, makes Mrs Danby appear
           what she is: not a saint, but an unworthy woman. So let me,
           dear cousin, beg that you will satisfy yourself and not
           impair your health by your immoderate sorrow and grieving,
          nor offend him who is able to make the very stones bear
           witness for your innocency which, I pray believe me, is
           believed by all worthy and noble and worthy persons.
           As for my worthy Lady Frankland, she doth both love and
           honour you as a woman of excellent parts, and pities
          you as one that hath been so much wronged by all your
           servants. I desire you not to write until I consider and see you.
          And I must needs tell you that my Lady told my husband
           — that of all the sermons that ever she heard in all her life —
          that sermon that your son Comber preached before my
           Lord Falconbridge was the very best. And for her part, she
          can never have an evil thought of him while she breathes
          but doth believe he hath been much wronged.
      
         
            You may see what God can and will do for you and yours;
           for which mercy, let you and me praise his holy name, and
           give him thanks forever and cheerfully suffer what
          he pleaseth to lay on us.
         
          
          
         
              Thus far I thought good to enter here that some
           of my friends and children see that God had in a manner, as she
           said,  raised the stones to vindicate and speak for me against hell itself, and to confute all my wicked adversaries
           when my very friends and servants was stirred up against us;
           because I had a desire to have the gospel planted in my family,
           I was made a scorn
              
             of those that hated it and me for it. And God
          opened the mouths of these very friends to stand for my innocency

             and to right my cause where I could not do it myself

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.186&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 186</a>






            

          in regard that this match was of so great a concernment
          to myself and family, because my enemies had stirred up all
          my friends against me, and had raised up such numbers of 
           lies and slanders against me for it that it might have been prevented;
          and to make my life more miserable by the breaking it so ill
          and from the cause of those odious slanders cast on my innocent
           actions; and for the settlement of my family and children in
          some comfortable condition in the world, 
         
               I am obliged in duty to God first, and the clear 
          satisfaction of my own conscience, the world and my own
           family (whose good I have ever established before my own)
          to leave behind me the full evidences of truth concerning
          this business: when it began, and how proceeded, and upon what
        occasion the affair was first thought upon, with a good
          and mature deliberation.
         
           As letters of mine will manifest, both to my husband
           and to very many of my dear friends and relations, who had
           been endeavoured to have turned my enemies by Mrs Danby until
           by God's providence the matter was tried out and my cause
           heard. And those which was my friends could not but pity my
           sad calamity which fell under the scourge of the tongue.
      
         
              I had no better evidence to satisfy my friends and all
          virtuous persons which had been abused by her malice to me
          but to make a collection of letters, papers, verses and my
           answer to my adversaries — who had reined in my house and
           had bitter malice against me for reproving their sins, to
          be revenged of me then to raise up the devil of lies and
           odious calumnies, which I am sure in their own conscience I
          was so clear that I hated them with a perfect hatred and would
           have died before I had been guilty — so that these evidences
           will, I hope, be kept by my children for a justification of my
          innocency and a condemnation of all their wickedness
          who had any hand by the murder committed on my <span class="quote">good
          name</span> and innocency. And will rise up in judgement against
          all those liars and forgeries which has not repented and asked
           pardon of God and us, who they wronged.

               the presentation of Stonegrave living, and Mr Holland

             Letters of mine to my Lord Frescheville, when Mr Jackson
          went up to London about the business of Stonegrave
             living,
             for Mr Bennett's consent for Mr Thornton to have a lease of it,
          and my Lord Frescheville endeavours with Bishop of Canterbury to consent
          that it might be obtained for Mr Comber. This sent up by Mr Jackson
             to solicit at that time, when I gave him £5 for his reign

            
             but he did nothing in it. (But it was afterwards gotten by Mr
               Lane's solicitation afterwards, for which I gave him £5.) 
         
         
         
           
            
             
           
               The payment of the £100  by my brother Denton from me
               before he would consent to make a lease to Mr Thornton, or resign
               according to his desire, being the first years due (as he said)
          out of the rents to him. But neither Mr Thornton or Mr Comber
               knew of the payment of it, nor ever was desired to be paid.
               This paid when Mr Comber was at London (June 25, 1666).
          Paid to Mr Bennett by my brother Denton from me, which
        
               I did do for to procure a standing ministry to be fixed
          in this family and country when we were destitute of the 
        ordinances of God in the Church of England.

          made to our content from Mr Bennett. And Mr Comber was
          placed in the same living by Mr Thornton to officiate the cure until
             after Mr Bennett's death. The presentation was procured for
          Mr Comber by the great kindness of my Lord Frescheville and of

             sent me word his uncle Thornton had done it and made a new deed
          of settlement — Mr Comber feared the grief of this had caused

          and sick on that miscarriage upon the news of Mr Covill's

          heard another settlement was made of it to other uses
             from my children, as I have made mention of in this Book.
             Upon which, the grief had like to have killed me and did bring me
             to a miscarriage because, if I had died, then my children
             had been left without any certain provision at all,</span> which
        
        I took so to heart as that I could not but write my
             thoughts to my husband. And in my letter gave him such
          pressing and true reasons for his consenting to the motion
             of marriage for my daughter, Alice, to Mr Comber (both on the
        
             reason of his own often sickness of the palsy and his relapse,
          together with my now great weakness on me that I could
             hope that either of us should continue long). And that this
               gentleman was so hopeful and promising; might be a great
          stay and support to take care both of my son in his education
             and of the other two daughters after our decease. 
               

             
         
               And what a comfort it might be to us to leave our 
           children in the hand of one that we knew would be
           careful to bring them up in the true faith and fear of God, and
           would take care of their temporal estate, which he knew in
           what a condition it was in at present. So, I humbly
          left the consideration of this weighty affair to his consideration and begged of God to direct us both to do for the
           best, for his glory and our comfort in our children's happiness.
         
         
         
         
            
           Upon which letter to my dear husband, that he said too,
           had a very good opinion of Mr Comber and did know
          he was a very hopeful man of good learning and parts. And
          believe he would be a great man

          him to have her than any other, though he could match her
             to a neighbour of a great estate, but if Mr Comber would
             be no prejudice to him to stay for her (she, being too young 
             yet to marry).

          made acquainted after his motion, returned him many
          thanks for his good opinion of him and that he would
             endeavour to deserve her. And, if it pleased him to give
             his consent for him, he would stay for her if it were
          seven years so he might obtain that happiness.

        Thornton made answer that he would give his consent if he would think fit to stay until she was at
            age 
               suitable to enter into a married estate.

       earnest desire to see her and of his fear the news of his

          to bed of my last child, and returned to me again after
          my recovery.</span><span class="event" id="ev193-start">
         
              These things was taken hold on by my wicked
           adversaries and perverted to a false use against me, and on which
        most horrid lies forged and broached, which Mrs Danby knew to
          be such, yet had not the grace to let me know of it that I
          might have cleared the business and declared the truth
           against them. But she, having malice against me for
           Madam Danby's turning her out for her abusive tongue,
          took this way of revenge;
      
         
            keeping it in her breast until, by their lies, I was 
          ruined and brought to a public scorn, <span class="evquote">as poor Susanna
           was before the judges, who was wronged by the false witness
            of two wicked elders</span>. Even so was I and my poor child
           accused and condemned before her, in her chamber, by her
             said servant in a most notorious manner, and all my
          chaste life and conversation most wickedly traduced.
         
              So that she railed on me and scolded at me and my
                poor innocent child, before our faces, with the most vile expressions

               

            
          could be imagined, while we had no time or liberty to
          justify ourselves against them, but with our tears and sorrows
           to commit our cause to God, who knew all hearts and would justify
           our innocency to be wronged and would, I hope, judge our enemies
          for the false lies and calumniations against us.
      
         
           Such was the fury of Barbary's malice against us that,
           with a brazen face she impudently cried out against me,
           and said I was naught and my parents was naught, and all
           that I came on was naught which — when I heard these
          blasphemous speeches against the unspotted honour and holy
           life of my parents — it more wounded me than my own. For
           they was long since died, honourable deaths and lived holy, exemplary
           lives whose honour is to all eternity: to have them blemished
           for my cause was like a sword to my soul.
         
              So that I fell down before the mistress and her maid in a
           sound for my great calamity. When coming to myself, did
          humbly pour out my bitter agonies to my gracious God to
           have mercy upon me, and pity my sad condition, and to
          revenge the cause of myself and all those righteous persons
          which these instruments of the devil had raised up against
           me. <span class="evquote">And to stop the mouths of these hell hounds that did</span>

         blaspheme my honour and that wronged the righteousness
           of the dead who had lived such holy, exemplary lives.
          And I was so extremely tormented with these slanders
          that I mourned and wept so extremely, with her loud
           clamours against us</span><span class="event" id="ev193a-start">that my dear husband, being
          then walking in the hall, heard the sad tragedy and abuse
           was put on me. And in a great anger, he came to the door
           of the scarlet chamber and broke it open. And hearing my complaint,
           and seeing my condition, did kick that wench downstairs
          and turn her out in great rage for so wickedly doing
          against me. And had certainly kicked out Mrs Danby 
           too, but that I begged he would not because she had no house
          nor harbour to go to and I trusted God would revenge my cause.
          </span><span class="event" id="ev193b-start">
         
           Until afterwards, she was so wicked (and be full of malice
          against me) that my dear husband would not endure her
           in his house, but turned her out and sent her to York (when I
           did relieve her necessity, though she did study my destruction,
          and gave her to keep her £8  to live on,
           
         
         
           which few would have done</span> but that my God bid me,
           <span class="quote">render no man evil for evil</span> but <span class="quote">if thy enemy hunger,
             feed him, et cetera</span>). For God is sufficient to receive
               
             my cause, and
           in him I did believe that he would do it and, to his glory be it
          spoken, has done it, even upon <span class="event" id="ev194-start">this wretched woman, her
            maid, whose remarkable judgement was known to all: that
           her conscience flew in her face when she was a dying at Malton.
           And she cried out to God for pardon and forgiveness of God,
          and said she was utterly damned for what she had done
           against me and Mr Comber, and what she had said of us: for she
           did us wrong and that her mistress set her on against me.</span>
      
         
              <span class="event" id="ev195-start">Thus was I brought down at that time into my weak
          and sorrowful bed by exceeding torments of body and
           soul. Yet, I would not let her lies and slanders rest unexamined, by my brother Denton, of all the servants which they
          had charged with their lies. But they with all consent cried
          out against them too and did justify me from every one of
           all their stories and slanders, being much grieved for their lies:
          for they had never seen or heard any evil by me nor Mr
        
        Comber or my daughter in all their lives. This was some comfort to
          me: that they had the grace to confess the truth.</span> And I

           humbly blessed the God of mercy which had judged my cause
           and in him, I trust, will do it to the end of my days, against
           hell and all his malice to accuse me: in whom, I hope, he nor
          his shall ever have any part, though he torment me with his lies as
           he did poor Job and stirred up God against me. Yet, in my redeemer,
           I still hope that, as he vouchsafed <span class="quote">to deliver him from his snares,
            
           so I trust in his providence I shall be ever</span> kept from him forever.
         
              Though I was extremely weak by this saddest trial of my unspotted honour, yet still I was supported under it that I did not
           sink or was murdered by it but, blessed be the great name of my
          God, he did raise me up very many friends that pitied my
          sorrows and condition, and made it their business to confound
           all these liars by declaring the truth of my sincere actions.
         
           
           
           <span class="event" id="ev196-start">
              After this sad trouble raised up by Mrs Danby, my dear
                husband did cause me to write to this woman, and set his
           hand to it, in a sad letter to let her know that she had carried
          herself so impudently against myself and child; that
          I was cast down into my bed of sickness and weakness upon
           my woeful slanders, which did torment me and was like to have
           killed me; and did hope in God he would <span class="evquote">judge my cause</span>
           from those horrid blasphemies against myself and holy parents,
          but I could not endure such things to be said of the dead who
           was laid in the bed of honour and their names recorded in
           heaven. Therefore, did desire she would prepare to go whither
          she might act her own affairs since she had made me not
          capable to serve her any longer, and sent her the £3  which made
           up the last £5  to be £8 to provide for herself. I, being
           in so weak a condition, expected nothing but death, but did
          hope that as God knew my wrongs and innocency so he would
           judge me righteously. (August 12th, 1668.)
         
           After this, my aunt Norton and Mr Thornton did
           persuade and advise her to go out of the house, and she hired a coach
          to carry her away</span><span class="event" id="ev197-start">that very day that my dear husband
           went to Malton (as he told my aunt Norton) to be revenged
          of old Mr Tancred, which had abused me in saying that if
          Mr Thornton was dead I would be married within a month.
      
         
              But my dear husband knew this was so false a lie
           (knowing that design of my daughter's marriage long before)
          that he would not be persuaded by none to be turned from
           going to Malton and that upon the aforesaid reason, though he
           charged her not to tell me until he was gone.</span> <span class="event" id="ev199-start">But, to my greater
           grief, I lost my earthly joy there at Malton — nor ever

           carried him away (September 17, 1668), and so left me <span class="evquote">a desolate and sorrowful widow</span>

             
              to endure great afflictions and uncomfortable times to undergo, of which I have rehearsed many dread crosses.</span>
         

         
           <span class="event" id="evn17-start">
           By reason of my vile slanders, which it pleased God
          to permit me to fall under, I was reduced into a dangerous
           sickness which followed me, so that I was advised — notwithstanding all the horrid lies of Danby and her maid had spread
          all over to my great and excessive sorrow,</span> <span class="event" id="ev200-start">and had persuaded
          Dr Samways and my Lady Yorke against Mr Comber's match
           and all endeavours (as I have rehearsed before) to break it</span> — 
      
         
            yet, I hope by the providence of God, so to order this
           thing by advice of my truest friends (considering my
          own great weakness) to make an end of the business
          which would be a comfort to me. To see that effected which had
          been so long intended, and to prevent the mischief to befall
          on all my children if my grief should break my

           and they would fall under greater exigencies than ever (if
          they should fall under the total power of those that
          had procured £800 to be paid to them in case of my dear
            son's death without issue).
      
         
              I have related all circumstances of letters and of the
        actings about the marriage which was done in private for many
           reasons (nor until it was public by all consent, not to come
           together).

            Heard) to Daphne, upon her writing to let her know how
          Mrs Danby abused me and laid slanders upon her since
          she went away; but Mary utterly denies all and that she never
          saw or heard, or knew any evil by me in all her life, and
          cries out against Mrs Danby to be so treacherous. This
           letter dated, May the 12th, 1669. London.

              After the appraisement of Mr Thornton's personal estate
          and all those great concerns about the administration and the
        
        value of the goods, and my cousin Anthony Norton's taking on him
           that kind office and my own taking the tuition of my
             children, <span class="event" id="ev203-start"> Daphne — being a material witness to all these
           actions and doing me great and considerable services — 


         
           She, fearing her husband's displeasure for leaving him
           so long, returned home and by her I sent my own 'Book of
             My Life' (the collections of God's <span class="evquote">dealings and mercies to me and
          all mine</span> until my widowed condition)

         
         
              that she might be able to satisfy all my friends of my
           life and conversation; that it was not such as my deadly
           enemies suggested, and the reasons I had to take care for all
           my poor children, and what condition I was reduced

               

             into after the
            
           entail was cut off, and many other great remarks of my life
          which I know would take away all those scruples and false
          calumnies against my proceedings in that match.
         
           This poor woman did show the said Book to my aunt
             Norton and several other friends; as my Lady Wyvill — which
            
        sent to her to let her know how much I was wronged and to
           speak to her about me — with great grief and many tears did
           express her concerns and pitied my case, saying that I had
          ever been a most virtuous woman all my life and now to
           be so abused did wound her very 
        [heart]
    . And so got my Book
           of her to read, which she did with a great delight (as she said) and yet with
        much grief to see me so greatly wronged by those I had done
           so much for. And did heartily beg of God that he would
           <span class="evquote">judge my cause</span> and revenge my wronged innocency upon all
           that had a hand in it, and prayed heartily for me and mine.
           </span>
           
           And did, when she returned my Book to Daphne,

            write a most excellent, pious and comfortable letter to me
           and prayed God to bless and <span class="quote">preserve me and all mine</span>, and that good
             man who was so maliciously evil spoken of; and that good
           God, who had kept me ever since I was born, both could and
          would deliver me in his good time and revenge me of all my
           enemies, and would bring good out of all these wrongs which
        had undergone for his sake, the church's and my family's.
         
              Praying me to take his visitation patiently for he knew
          all my life and would make me be delivered
               
             for his mercy's sake
           and for his own glory and my comfort. Thus, with many Christian
           arguments did this holy, good Lady strive to comfort me.

         
           And, indeed, I had great cause to bless and praise the
           God of heaven, which gave me such comfortable letters of this good
             and dear Lady and the rest; for which I praise my God for this mercy
           and all of this kind, beseeching him to bless her and all hers with his
           choicest of mercies and happiness; rewarding her with the kingdom of
          heaven and all the rest of my dear friends in my distress.
      

         
           I did also receive at this time my said Book home,
           when my dear aunt Norton returned it (that Daphne carried)
           which did abundantly please and satisfy her and said that it was
          not writ as if a weak woman might have done it but might
           have become a divine. Though she knew the contents to be of my
           whole life to that time, but she gave me her advice that the sense
           of the world was in general of the match of my daughter, Alice,

         
          and that she was put on it to come to Newton about it
           (but the season bad and her husband sick did prevent) and that
          Mr Scott had some daughters for a match for Mr Comber.
         
          She believed that want of preferment was the only stop and for her
           part she had no prejudice against him, having his pious
          works with her, but wishes some other way be found to compass
           
           this matter. Dated: October 20, 1668.

              Since my dear aunt had been so much influenced by
          Dr Samways and he made flexible
             to Mrs Danby's false abuses
          and slanders against him, because he would not hearken to
           her insinuations to break off with my child most perfidiously,

          Batt to entice him to marry her and that she had £100 portion
           by which he might have procured a living, and so Mrs Danby would
          have lived with them in the house, which design Mr Comber did abhor
           and told her at Newton long before:
      
         
            'Ah, Mrs Danby, would you have me play such an unjust act
           to this young gentlewoman and her parents to be so unworthy as to
          break all engagements to them and to marry another which you know

I began upon your advice and knowledge? I tell you I will never
           be so base and unworthy nor treacherous to her and them,
           who has been so kind to me and procuring this living of Stonegrave.
           You shall excuse me for I never will betray them, and my love
          is so fixed upon this pretty lady that I will never forsake
           her', or to this purpose he spoke to her.
         
           Upon this answer, Mrs Danby turned his utter enemy forever after because she could not work her own ends of him.
           And this is most certainly true: that if she had believed him to
           be guilty of those horrid slanders which she cast on him and me,
          which she had long before that heard and examined,
      
         
         
         
               she would never have admired him so much and
           endeavoured to match him to the best friend she had (as she ever
           called Mrs Batt). 
       </span>
       <span class="event" id="ev205-start">
           But, from that time forward, she studied how
          to do us a mischief and went away with that woman to Howley
          to the Countess of Sussex, where she was an eyewitness of all
           the villainies done by the Earl and his Lady, most odious, and did
          see when six of the maids of the house servants was by the said
           made to dance naked. And there was one modest, chaste maid,
           which told the countess that she would not do it when she pressed
           her to it, and said she would not stay in such a place where it was 
           done and immediately quitted the service.
      </span>
         
         
           I had not writ these lines but to set forth the vile hypocrisy of this woman, Mrs Danby, which would have used any
           unjust means against us which, when she saw in vain and no
           just cause for it, she turned all our implacable enemies
      
         
            and did pervert our honest intentions of a holy, chaste
           match to ruin our honours if she could. But, blessed be God, it
           was not in her power or Satan's that set her on work, but she had
          proposed this way to break it by my aunt; <span class="quote">what God had
           pleased to determine in his wisdom to bring about, it was not in
           man or devil's power to frustrate</span>.
         
    
         
           My Lord Frescheville's kind letter after Mr Thornton's death;
           he intends to see me and my children when he comes to York
           (October 24, 1668 and November 18, 1668).
         
         
    
         
           My niece Fairfax, her condoling letter of my loss of my
             husband and my weak condition by sickness (November 20, 1668).
         
         
    
         
              Daphne's kind and faithful letter of the discourse with my
          aunt Norton and her advised to come with him to Newton to break the
           match of my daughter, Alice, with Mr Comber because Mrs Danby had
          so far incensed my Lady Yorke against him that they desired
          my aunt to come to Newton to break the match.

         But she said she would not come until she heard what Daphne
          told her, for she would believe the character she gave him and
          what she said, which she did declare nothing, or could do against
           him, but that those lies was told on purpose to break this and to
           have him for Mrs Batt though they had done wickedly in it to us all.
      
         
           Upon which, Daphne said that all my best friends did advise
          me to make an end of this marriage and then they would be
           quiet and satisfied. Upon which, Daphne was to come over the next
           week, and all things was to be got ready in order to the writings
          and settlements made of her portion to secure it to her trustees
           for her use and her children's. Lord, assist me in this great work,
          and prosper all our lawful designs with thy providence to thy
           glory and church's good and the comfort of us all (November 1st, 1668).

           A good omen. That Mr Comber, taking out a licence to be
          in order to the marriage got by him at York upon a most remarkable day to our church for her deliverance from the popish gunpowder treason; that very day, November 5, 1668, did he take out his
           licence for his marriage with my daughter, Alice Thornton.
           </span>
          The Lord have mercy on them both and bless them with all blessing
           suitable for that marriage estate of life <span class="quote">for Jesus Christ, his sake</span>.
          Amen and Amen.
      
         
    
         
              This following letter of honest Daphne's should have been first
           entered, being come soon after she went from Newton and she had
          heard that my Lady Yorke had come to Newton to have broke the
            match and have stolen my child from me, et cetera.
         
         
           Daphne, her kind letter to comfort me when she left me after Mr Thornton's
           death, and she left me extreme weak and sick for the loss of him and
           malice of my implacable enemies to prevent the match (and had
          intended to have broken it upon the odious terms which
            
           was imaginable, nor Christian's part to make wounds instead
           of healing up breaches).
         
           Daphne told me in this that it grieved her to hear that <span class="event" id="ev207-start">my
           Lady Yorke was come so soon to Newton and, instead of comforting
           me, she would do me much harm and no good. For Dr Samways
          had been at York with Mrs Danby and she had incensed him against
           Mr Comber, and he had incensed my Lady Yorke, so that she came
          to take away my dear child from me under the pretence of having
           her confirmed.

           When this malicious woman saw that all my friends, and
           everyone that she told her impudent lies to, did not believe any
          of her stories against me, but that I had ever walked in an unspotted chastity all my life, I bless God, then she flew upon this
          poor man by stories that she had either invented or others.
         
           And so began to abuse him, as if she was confident I was
           innocent of all those calumnies cast on me, and her conscience did
           own it that I was wronged, but then did asperse him from some
           others of things that was not right done. And so, by this deceit
          wrought on my Lady Yorke and Dr Samways to have broke
          that match, secretly intending to bring the other of Mrs Batt to
           pass, which not being known to my friends she wrought on them.

    <span class="event" id="ev209-start">
         For, before this fire of her malice broke out in public against
           us, she, with her secret insinuations had spoke to myself of
          some stories that had been raised against Mr Comber and pretended
           was told her at Bedale, and out of her tender love to her cousin,
             Alice, and myself — which she knew I hated all things of evil, or
          tendencies or appearances of evil in all, much more in any which
        
        I should match my child to — 
         
               she thought fit to acquaint me with what she said she
           had heard. Upon which, I was so extremely afflicted and grieved,
           though only for such things as others would not account ill, that
           I did burst out into many tears and told her, if I did believe
           that he had been guilty of any incivilities, et cetera, I would first
          bury my child before I would yield to mary her to him
          or any that I knew of so inclined.
         
           She was mightily concerned to see me in such a passion at it,
          and prayed I would not condemn him before I knew more and begged
           I would not cast him off for such a report. And, if I pleased, she
           would first go to him (being in his chamber at
               
           study) and she
           would charge him with such a thing as she had heard; and she
          would tell him that I had sent her on purpose to let him know
           that I had been told; and that he should either clear himself,
           or else I would never consent he should have my daughter.
      
         

           Upon which, I was more pacified and bid her go to him
           with that message from me for I loved virtue in all its branches.
           So, she did go to him with this message and did relate all as
           she said to me and my answer. On which acquainting him, as
           above, what that forgery against him, he was in so great a concern and grief that he was in a violency of trouble and like to have
           fallen down with sorrow, and with all the bitterness of weeping and
           trouble protested his innocency of any evil or of that which
           he was charged. And told her, he should hate himself if ever
           she should be any way guilty of any incivility of that kind
           and begged of me, if it could be proved against him, not to own
           him ever again, with many protestations to her of his great wrong.
      
         
              Insomuch she was so fully satisfied of it that she came to
           me again and did become his compurgator,
             and said she
          was confident it was a great lie made by some that had a malice
           against him. And she would inquire more into it and bring me word,
           but begged I would never harbour any ill opinion of him; for
           she never saw any man in such a terror and grief, with tears and other
          great expressions
               
           of his wrong, and was confident he was abased in it
           and begged me not to have any ill opinion, for he was innocent.

         But, on the next opportunity, I spoke to him myself, I was so very
          much affected at what she had told me that I could not be satisfied
           without discoursing him my thoughts. But he did, with many great
           and solemn protestations, vindicate himself and showed some
           urgent reason why that party had abused him, because she expected
           to be cast out of that living, which she hoped to have upon marrying
           one of that gentleman's chaplains. And she, fearing he would lose it 
          because Dr Samways had proffered it to Mr Comber, she knew
           no way to secure it to that man she intended to marry than by
           this indirect way of scandal to make the doctor to throw him off.
      
         
           After this, he told me that this was made use of to his
           utter ruin here, and that if I believed it should do him much
           wrong; for he knew all was done to prevent it but he, being in
           so great affliction upon this, with his clearing himself in his
          general good behaviour at all times and upon Mrs Danby's enquiring of the said matter more fully, found this was a matter
          of private revenge in that woman, and she did deny what they
           said in all the circumstances of it. And again, did fully convince me of it  and perfectly cleared and pitied him, so abused.
      

         
              And this was the very business which Mrs Danby made
           use of again to have broken this match.</span> And which she was so
           much convinced of was a lie made of him, yet did she go
           now on to revive against him and me for marrying my child to him.
      
         
         
              These was very ill practices thus used to gain her own
           ends against the vote of her own conscience. I pray God she
           might have repented of all these wicked slanders against a
           minister of God's word and my lawful, honest proceedings.

            did see fit in vindication of me to say to my aunt, further,


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.204&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 204</a>






            
           
          
         he must further say in justification of my actions that I was
            compelled — out of a prudent care of my children and necessity — to 
            dispose of my daughter, Alice, to a good and a wise and careful person
            as Mr Comber was, and he knew him so to be. And therefore, he hoped
          none of my friends would condemn me for acting for the
            good and comfort of my children and family, 
         
      
         and he, being a man of learning and piety and parts, did
        not doubt but by God's blessing he would come to preferment.
        This letter (dated January 2, 1668) and sent to my aunt Norton
          by the hand of faithful Daphne, when she went home after
        the marriage of my child as before said.
        
        
              Which letter did give great satisfaction to my uncle and
          aunt Norton; being written by so wise and good a man as my
            brother Denton, which knew all the intrigues of this family
          and of whom I had advised with from the first motion of the match,

            
          who did approve of it in the said manner as to Mr Comber's abilities,
          only he had not at present an estate. But said to me, as he did
          to my aunt, no doubt but he would gain preferment and
          here was Stonegrave living might be obtained for him.
      
      
        
          
          
          
             The next was my own two letters by Daphne to my aunt
                to set out more at large my true and sad condition by Mr Thornton,
               his death, my own great sickness and weakness by the heavy
               burdens of my estate (being left in £1500  debt, having nothing
               to maintain or educate my only son but £100  for all a year).

         
            And lastly, my own saddest condition by the viperous tongues
           and malice of Danby, and my wicked servants upheld by her,
           to defame my virtue and constant chastity ever kept entire by God's
          gracious goodness to me, which she knew a year and kept it on purpose
           to ruin me and not the grace to let me know how I was wronged,
           so that my Lady Yorke was incensed by her (and Dr Samways now)
           to take my child from me. And therefore, I was advised to do this,
           being for my support and relief to choose this way, since Mr Denton
           did concur in it, knowing the state of my sad affairs.
      
         
           Which I hope she would please to join with my brother Denton
           to let my friends know his letter, which I hoped in God would
           vindicate my actions to all the world and — especially to my 
           Christian friends — to have some pity of my sad condition, and
           to believe the truth and pray for me, and to satisfy objections raised
           against me for this match which was done on such good grounds.
           
        
      

        
          These letters was sent by the hand of Daphne Lightfoot after
          the marriage of my daughter, Alice, to Mr Thomas Comber,
          January 2nd, 1668, minister of God's word at Stonegrave in
          the parish of my husband's ancestors and near to his estate and
          kindred.
          
          
      </p>
      <p id="div-025a" class="prayer">
         
           O my God, I have humbly begged and craved thy holy
          direction, advice and assistance in the disposal and choice of a
           suitable match for this my dear and eldest child, even before


        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.205&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 205</a>






            I entered upon the thought of it (being brought into
          so great extremity of necessity by the sad concerns of my
          dear husband's temporal affairs by unjust debts and other troubles
           which induced us to dispose of her sooner than we intended).
         
           But, since by thy gracious providence, thou, in thy wisdom thus
          to order things of this life to be so uneasy by afflictions,
          grant that it may be for the good of our souls and spiritual
           advantage. That we, choosing for our better part in this match, which is not
          for the riches of this world, but a desire to gain eternal riches
           with thee in thy kingdom in the first place and to obtain of thee,
           O Lord, the way to obtain eternal life, not only for ourselves
           but for our dear children and family, and place of our abode which thou
          hast cast my lot into.
      
         
           And that, as I have undergone many dreadful trials and
          temptations, both as to the exercises of thy graces of faith and
          patience, thou hast upheld my soul from sinking under them
        or being overcome by the malice of hell or despair of thy
           mercy, but upheld me and delivered me from what was evil and
           brought this marriage to a happy conclusion, in despite of all
           my enemies which hell raised up against me to destroy me for it.
         

           So, O Lord, most holy and gracious, still do to me and
            mine for
          thy own glory, and of your

        mercy show pity, and compassion on
           me,  thy poor, humble handmaid, servant and widow. And
           upon these, thy servants, who are now entered into thy holy
          ordinance of marriage and vouchsafe to give them a great
          share of thy Holy Spirit, with all gifts and graces for this estate
          to which they are now entered.
         
           And as thou, holy Jesus, <span class="quote">the author and finisher of our faith</span>
          did vouchsafe to do <span class="quote">thy first miracle on earth at a marriage
           in Cana of Galilee to do that honour at that feast to turn water into
            wine</span>, so —
           O thou, gracious Jesus —
           do thou come and show thy
           miracles of mercy upon these two servants; for whom thou hast done
           so wonderfully to bring and unite them in marriage, who was so far
          distant by that place of their birth and under such great trials before
          they was united.
         
           Do thou, O Lord, have mercy upon them; pardon and forgive
          all our sins which makes us unworthy of the least of thy mercies
          and by the power of thy majesty turn all our afflictions into a
           happy change. Oh, turn our bitter waters of sorrows into the sweet
          and comfortable wine of thy most Holy Spirit; heal our infirmities
           and love us freely. Let them be married to thee in faith and love
          and to each other in all conjugal affection.

         Oh, make them fruitful <span class="quote">in all good works</span>, but especially make
          him — the husband of my dear child — a glorious instrument of
          thy gospel, a converter of souls to thy kingdom and a vessel prepared for thy sanctuary to set forth thy name in this generation,
          and a painful labourer in thy vineyard and to bring many to
           righteousness by his holy life and godly example that when
          he comes to give up his accounts, he may do it with joy and not
          with grief, nor let him while he preaches to others become himself
          a cast away.
         
           Oh, dear and gracious <span class="quote">Father of mercies</span>, the God of all comfort and consolation, be gracious to this, my dear child,
          whom thou hast so many and wonderfully times delivered, and let
          me bring forth with peril of my life and delivered her from so
           many deaths. Oh, do thou, O my God, fulfil thy grace in her 
          and let her be spared to me for a great blessing (as she has been
           to me and others). Let her life be now blessed to her and to me, and
           her husband to whom by great providence thou hast united her
          in love. Bless her, with all blessings, in order to eternity.
         
              With <span class="quote">blessings of the breasts and blessings of the womb</span> and
          if it be thy pleasure make her womb a plentiful nursery of
          thy kingdom and many heirs of salvation, keep her in
          all the accidents of this life which may do hurt. <span class="quote">Bless her
          with all holy and religious graces of thy good spirit to be
           a holy, modest, chaste and pious, and virtuous, obedient wife</span>
           to walk without scandal and to be a blessing to this her
          family. Give them, O Lord, I humbly beseech thee a blessed
          and competency in this life, that they may have where
           with to do good to others and to serve thee with comfort.
      
         
           
           And if it be thy good pleasure let them live to serve
           thee in old age in virtue, grace, and piety to bring up their
          posterity in thy faith and fear; and make them heirs of
           salvation and a comfort to me <span class="quote">thy desolate widow</span>.
          All these and what else thou seest fit for thy glory and
           our good, I humbly crave in the name and for the sake of
           our only dear Lord and saviour, Jesus Christ, our Lord,
          and give thee all possible thanks and praise and glory for
           all thy goodness to us and ours.
           Saying as he taught us
           in thy holy form of prayer, saying, '<span class="quote">Our Father which art ...'.
          Amen, Amen. Amen</span>.
          
         

       
    <span class="event" id="ev211-start">
         After the solemnisation of the marriage Daphne
          was dispatched by me home with the letters mentioned and
         other businesses I had to do for her,
         having been

         kind to her, as she had deserved from me in performing the
         office of a faithful friend and Christian to us in our distress, and
         gave her a Bible for her husband and a pound of tobacco,
          and withal gave for herself a young cow of three years old and
         a calf, which was most kindly and gratefully acknowledged by
           her husband and herself and children.</span>
         
         
    
         
           I received a grateful and kind letter from Daphne (dated
           January 8, 1668) of her acquainting my aunt Norton and my
           uncle Maulger Norton of the marriage of my daughter, Alice, and
           of all the concerns of that affair, so they were all very well
          pleased with it and prayed God to bless them and wished them
           good luck of their marriage. But Mr Norton asked, why
           did they not lie together; on which, Daphne said that it was
          by general consent agreed on that it was more convenient
          to defer that until the publication of the marriage when
           we should invite friends to it. And it may please God I might
           be stronger and be better in my health, having had such a 
          great deal of sorrow on my husband's death and for the sad
          slanders falsely raised on me.
      
         
           After which discourse, both of them said it was very well
           and prudently done and prayed God to bless and strengthen me.
         
           Thus, I see the mercies and goodness of the Lord, my God, to me
          who both can and hath overruled the perverse wills of men and
          in much pity had compassion upon my soul and his suffering
           handmaid. In him will I still put my trust for deliverance, who
          has in a great measure heard and answered my humble petitions
           and begun to turn the hearts of my friends towards me.
         
           <span class="quote">Oh, what shall I return the Lord, my God, for all his exceeding
           and infinite mercy and goodness towards his handmaid</span>? And do
           beg still his grace to uphold me and vindicate my cause and, for
           his own name's sake, <span class="quote">redeem my soul out of trouble</span> and to make
          my innocency appear to his glory and the confusion of my bitter
           enemies who wished my destruction. Glory be to the great and
           gracious <span class="quote">Father of mercies</span> which raised me up these friends to make
           the truth to appear and my innocency cleared. Blessed be thy holy
           name forever; oh, that I might glorify thy name in this life and
          to all eternity. Amen and Amen.

         
    
         
              I bless God, I also received a most kind and comfortable
          letter of my dear aunt Norton in answer to mine by Daphne of
           January 2, 1668/9,
             when I acquainted her with Alice's marriage and the reasons.

           January 8th, 1668/9.
           
           
           
           To which she returned that she was fully convinced and satisfied of the good ends and necessity of my occasion
          and reasons which was a great grief that I should be in such
          circumstances. But she did write a most pious and Christian
           letter, advising me for God's sake not to be so much afflicted
          in spirit nor sorrow too much for those abominable lies and
           slanders, which I never deserved but had a clear conscience from
           all the world ever since she knew me, and that was since I was born.
         
              And that God would deliver me out of them and would reward all my enemies for their wickedness according to their
          deserts. She wished me to satisfy my heart that God would do
           me good for what I endured,

               

            as he did to his servant, Job.
         
         
              She also prayed for me and wished me great comforts
          in this match for what sorrows I endured for my husband and
           children, and for God's cause as for the planting the gospel and
           support my family and children. And did fully believe that God,
           in his good time, will be my comfort and bring me out of all
          like gold tried in the fire seven times in the fire of affliction.
           And will also, in his own good time, when he had tried
          my faith and patience to depend upon him who had sent this
          sad affliction of being ill spoken of for good.
      
         
           He, being a just and upright judge of all the world, will
           <span class="quote">judge my cause</span> against all my cursed enemies and will
          make my <span class="quote">good name</span> which he had given me and was endeavoured
          to be taken away by the devil and his agents. But they shall
           never be able to do me wrong, but God will bring me out
           of all, as he did to Job, and make my <span class="quote">good name</span> <span class="quote">shine
             more bright as he did to his servant</span>, Job: therefore, I
          beg you will be comforted in that good God who never did
           nor ever failed me. Thus, that good, dear aunt did
           strive to give me comfort for which I give the Lord, my God,
           all humble and hearty honour
           and glory and praise forever. Amen.
         
         
    
         
              After I received this most comfortable letter from my
          dear and only aunt, I received another letter from good
          Daphne of her acquainting my other friends with the marriage
          of my dear child and of her procuring money for me to
           pay Mr Thornton's debts. And to let me know she had showed all
          my papers concerning the occasion and transaction of that
          affair from time to time for several years.
      
         
           But yet that false woman did still persist in her ill
          calumnies and abuses of me, which the Lord forgive her for what
           wickedness she has done and endeavoured against me or this man.
           She, saying that Daphne begs of me that I will not be grieved

        for her wicked malice towards me, for God will plead my
          cause for me and will not suffer me to die unrevenged of my
           horrid wrongs by those who had been preserved by charity.
          And that I must not be too much grieved at what the devil
           or man can say against me; for I may take comfort in myself, for none believes any ill of me, she blesses God. (January  10, 1668/9.)
         
         
         
         
           And for which comfort I have by the good hand and gracious
           providence of my God, and for these good friends of mine,
           especially for my dear aunt and Daphne, and cousin Nicholson, I humbly bless and praise the holy name of God, and pray that
        
           their souls may enjoy everlasting glory forever with him
           in heaven for a reward of their charity to me, a poor creature.
           Lord, grant my prayers and hear my request <span class="quote">for Jesus Christ's
           sake</span>, <span class="quote">who was accused by the wicked to do what he did by the
        
           power of the devil</span>. Let me, O Lord, have a part of this joy
           as I have been partaker of that suffering, holy Jesus in this kind.
          Amen, Amen, Amen.
      
         
         
         
              For which charitable and comfortable letters of my aunt and
          Daphne, I returned my grateful acknowledgement to them.
         
    
         
              My Lady Wyvill's most Christian letter to me after Mr Thornton's
          death and that she had sent for Daphne to acquaint her of my abuses
           and that Daphne had told her of my sad condition. My Lady,
          her condoling letter for my sad misfortunes in the loss of my
          husband and my other great afflictions. This writ after Daphne
           had carried her my book and she returned it by Daphne, who
           writ to me then. (October 12, 1668, and should have been entered 
           before marriage.)
      
         
         
         
    
           Also, honest Daphne's letter sent then (October 12, 1668)
           after she had showed my Book to my Lady. This letter was a
           comfortable letter. My Lady having sent for her by my mother's

           

           maid, Bess, who lived with my Lady Wyvill and to tell me of my sad
           abuses (Mrs Danby's abuses by her tongue she had put upon me).
           
          

         
           My Lady inquired what Danby it was. Daphne told her all <span class="event" id="ev212-start">the

           sad story of her being relieved from starving, with her husband and children,
          when my lady Danby had cast her out. And she had cost me some
          hundreds and that her malice was against me for Madam Danby's
          turning her out for me. But Madam Danby declared it was not that
        
           which turned her out from Bedale after her husband's death, but
           her own base, abusive tongue in railing against her. Yet, out
           of pity, I took her into my house, and fed and clothed, and kept her and hers</span>,

           but she still hated me and us for the reason aforesaid, which proceeded
          so much until she found an opportunity to be revenged of us in
          this manner. For <span class="event" id="ev214-start">she knew my husband's estate was much encumbered by debts and other charges about the payment of his brothers'
            and sisters' portions, and Sir Christopher Wandesford's suing him for the will
          of my father and taking on him the managery of the Irish estate
           to perform the will (but that cost him above £3000).
        </span> 
         
              <span class="event" id="ev214a-start">But she knew that the minister of our parish was a good
          and wise and ingenious

               
           man, which had been tabled by Mr Thornton's
           desire to pray and preach in the house and teach his children and catechise
           his family (He, being so much respected by Mr Thornton for his
           learning).</span> And that <span class="event" id="ev215-start">he had a proposal from the south (of one
           which had been his tutor) of marriage of his daughter with a living of
           £100  a year, and was like to be left to his choice to go thither or
           stay here, where he had taken a great liking to my daughter,
             Alice, and had made court to her and desiring Mr Thornton to
          give consent to him.
      
         
           Also, she knew that we both had a good opinion of his
          deserts and that he was here in the eye of preferment and being all this
          to her own knowledge and approved him so much herself that
          when he was at London to take his degree of Master of Arts that
           Mr Holland had set on him to accept of this motion of his daughter.
      
         
           So she, being then so much concerned in the case of her own
           mind and accord (May 20, 1666) did write to Mr Comber to let
           him know, if he let slip this opportunity of the advantage he might
           have of preferment here in the match with her cousin, Alice Thornton,
           he never would get the like and, if he would take her advice,
          it would be happy for him to come down and proceed in that he
          had begun in his amour to her.
      
         
           Upon which letter, he waived this other business, and came down
           into the north, and settled his thoughts here and prevailed with Mr Thornton
          to match here.</span> 
           <span class="event" id="evn18-start">And Mr Thornton had procured the living of Stonegrave
           to settle his child with him to be near his house and friends.</span>
      
         
         
           <span class="event" id="evn19-start">
         Afterwards, there was an accident happened in Mr Thornton's
           estate that, in his great sickness of the palsy, he was persuaded to
          cut off the entail of that part of his land which was settled for
          his younger children and to settle it on a second wife and children
          as well as on mine, which would have been cast out and have no
           provision settled for them and for the payment of debts (having all
           my portion and fortune gone before).</span> <span class="event" id="ev216-start">So that I, upon the hearing
           of this sad news, which was kept from me a year,
      

        <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_three&amp;p0.lo=p.211&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 211</a>






            
          

          but, being within a little of my time of my last child,
          was extremely afflicted for it and did beg I might have a sight
           of that last deed which, with much to do, I got and then, in a great
           concern of grief, made my application to my husband to recall
          this deed and to make a new one to resettle that land again
           upon my daughters (having but two, and one son).
         
           In the prosecution of this matter — I, having not one friend
           or relation of my own to repair to for counsel and advice —
          I was forced with my daughter Alice to make use of Mr Comber
           to go to counsel and writings drawn, and so to read and consider
          of these things what was best way to state that business. But the matter
           of the marriage not being made public but amongst ourselves,
           which was intended by God's blessing in due time.
      </span>
         
         
           There is always some busy folk — that was evil themselves — 
          judged ill of my daughter and myself for applying of our honest
           and troublesome occasions to be followed by him, God knows,
           which we were forced to make use of in this great concern of our estate,
          nor knew I any that was more proper than him to have matters
          done who was like to marry my own child.
      
         
    <span class="event" id="ev217-start">
         
           It seems some evil, malicious tongues had raised some
           scandal that we often met, us three, in discourse and that had been
          told to Mrs Danby, who knew our business and what dire necessity I was
           put upon, and the sad occasion of it. Yet did she not do like a
           Christian to me or mine, to let me know of their wicked censures
            
          of me and my daughter, but kept it in her breast from me but told
          others of their lies and so fostered them up so long until they had ruined
           my life and innocent, honest dealings. And then, in a most outrageous
           manner, flew at me with her lying servant with their slanders, which
          she knew in her own conscience to be such, </span><span class="event" id="ev218-start">until my dear husband
           heard her and them himself, and came into the chamber and broke open
          her door where they were persecuting of me.
      
         
              And was in such a rage that he called her a most impudent and
           unworthy, ungrateful woman, thus to torment his chaste and
             dear wife. And kicked her out, and the maid downstairs, for her
           wrongs and abused such a virtuous woman as I was and had done for her.
           But I begged he would not turn her out of the house then, having no
           harbour to go to, until, afterwards, she was so wicked still to carry so
           basely that it had like to have killed me.</span> But my gracious God and
           <span class="quote">Father of mercies</span> was my succourer and my deliverer from death and hell which they

         sought to bring me into. <span class="event" id="ev218a-start">But my dear husband would not 
           go out of his house to Malton before he turned her out himself,
           and so sent her in a coach to York, for he was not able to see me into
           that condition which I was brought by their abominable wickedness.
           And after he had sent her away, she was so mad at it that she
          had raised and fomented such horrid lies that had so abused me
           and us all about this marriage, which had come to my Lady's ears.</span>
         
         
    <span class="event" id="ev219-start">
         
           And, it seemed, Mr Thornton had been told by my Lady Yorke
          that he
           (Mr Tancred)
           
           would lay a guinea that, if Mr Thornton were dead,
          I would be married within a month to this Mr Comber, which my dear
          husband did take so heinously that he told Mrs Norton he
           would go to Malton that day (being at the fair) on purpose to meet
          with that old rogue (Mr Tancred) to be revenged of him for
           his abominable lies which he had aspersed his chaste wife.
      </span>
         
         
           Thus, I bless God, he did give me the comfort of my dear
             husband's most dear and faithful affection. As I hope in him,
          he had ever given me grace to persevere
               
             true faithful and all
          loyalty towards him both in life and death. And he knew it
          so to be that would have vindicated me with his blood: for he did
           know that consent of his child's marriage consented to by him.
      
         
           
           Thus, when my dear and noble Lady had heard all Daphne's
           history of my wrongs, and how it was begun and proceeded from
           bitter malice, and read my 'Book of My Life until My Widowhood',
           she could not hold from abundance of tears exceedingly,
           and cried out that woman deserved not to live, who had
           been such a traitor and Judas to me, to take away my honest,
           <span class="quote">good name</span> which she knew to be lies and had ruined my comforts, 
         
               and so wickedly not to declare how I was wronged or
          to stop their mouths by relating her knowledge of the intentions
          of marriage and of that of the estate. And she hoped God would in
          great mercy deliver me in his good time, and she was very
           glad that she had read 'My Book' and my papers that made out all the
        rehearsal of the marriage as before. And was much grieved
           when Daphne said she had left me in such a sad, disconsolate
           condition, and she did vindicate me from a child and of my
          innocency from those abuses; for she did resent my case as it
           were her own as long as she lived, and thanked God that she had
           sent for Daphne to tell her what she heard that, my Lady
           said, she might
           do me that right and show my cause to all her friends at Hornby,
           and to my Lady Dalton and all others where I was abused, for it
          did wound her 
        [heart]
    
        to hear such a child of God to be so wounded
           for God's cause and the providing for the children of my body.

         Lord Jesus, make me truly thankful to thy divine majesty 
           which would not let my <span class="quote">good name</span>, which thou in mercy had given
           me, to be murdered by all their wicked, lying tongues which are so

           Praised be the name of the Lord, my God, who had such pity
           on me, his distressed creature, who would not let me perish in the

            
           good opinion of thy servants, but has done great mercies for me
          and raised me Christian friends out of the dust and such as

          of a Christian faith and good conscience.
         
           <span class="quote">Blessed be the God of my salvation</span> forever, for this, his

           My Lady Yorke's letter of compliment to me, after Mr
             Thornton's death, of her intention to have come to see me but
          got a cold and was very ill and could not. She desires to have her
            god-daughter, Alice, being now at age to be confirmed and she
          would carry her to the bishop to be confirmed. She heard news of
         her god-daughter, which she could not believe, of her being married
          but she desires I would be advised in a thing of such consequences
           by my best friends. (January 23, 1668/9.)

           for her intentions to see me, and sorry her illness prevented it,
          and it was my desire also to have my daughter confirmed
           and do intend, God willing, to be so too, and then she shall have that
        benefit with me. And that I had advised with my good friends
          in the point of her match and so gave her a full answer to hers
           which I have entered before marriage in this book to which this
           refers. (My letterdated,  January the 26, 1668/9.)

          to do me mischief. But begs of God to support me and help
          me out of all, and that I will not so cast myself down
           for it. For her tongue is no slander having used all her
             husband's friends in the like kind. (February 5, 1668/9.)

         February 13th, 1668/9.
         
         
           This day, by the infinite and wonderful power, mercy
           and gracious goodness of almighty God and heavenly Father,
           has my life been spared me to complete my age, 42 years,
           which has been spun out with abundance of trial, dangers,
            
          difficulties and sorrows and sufferings which I could not have ever
          expected to have lived to have seen to this day since this time
          twelve months. The changes and hardship which I have gone
          through has been wonderful and miraculous, pungent

            and sharp, 
         
         
           which has fallen on my person, my spirit and estate:
           the loss of my dear delight on earth by my most excellent
          husband's health, his life, much of his estate. But I hope
           in my gracious Father in heaven, who <span class="quote">orders all things for the
           best</span>, even death itself for the best to them that loves God, 
         
              has so appointed this dissolving of his weak body
          that he might translate his precious soul to his heavenly
           kingdom and <span class="quote">has freed him from this body of sin</span> and bound
           up his soul in the bundle of life to serve him to eternity.
         
              And I most humbly beg and crave at the hand of my heavenly
           Father that he will please — in much mercy and pity to me, his poor
           handmaid, his faithful servant and widow — <span class="quote">to order so the many
          afflictions and trials sent to me in this world that I may not
           faint under them</span>. For to thee, O great and glorious God of all the
           earth, to thee shall all nations come; <span class="quote">for thou hast healings under
           thy wings</span>. Heal those wounds in my soul which sin and my enemies
           hath made and cure me from the bitings of my spiritual scorpions;
           for thou, O Lord, are the true brazen serpent <span class="quote">which healeth all those that
           come unto thee by faith</span>. <span class="quote">Thou art the way, the truth
               
           and the life</span>; <span class="quote">oh,
          suffer me not to faint nor fall in this weary pilgrimage</span>.
         
           Oh, sanctify, I humbly beseech thee, thy holy word, thy rod, thy
          spirit unto me that by all thy many and sundry chastisements
           are sent unto me from thy blessed hand, and by all thy corrections,
           mercies (spiritual and temporal) may be means to drive me to a true
           and catholic repentance of whatever I have offended thy majesty in
           my forepast life. Grant that I may wade through all the difficulty
          and dangers, sorrows and wickedness that is prepared for me by
           my enemies, spiritual and temporal; 
      
         
            I may by thy supporting, assisting hand and arm walk in safety;
           being upheld by thy power, preserved <span class="quote">by thy providence</span>, directed
           by thy spirit and guided by thy grace so that, at last, I may
          arrive at the land of everlasting rest where all tears and sorrows
           shall be done away, and that I enjoy thee, as thou art in thy glory, to
           sing all glory to the Lord  <span class="quote">God of my salvation</span>, <span class="quote">for Jesus Christ,
           his sake</span>. Amen. Amen.

          lays on me and he will bring me out of all like gold refined
          for his own glory and my eternal comfort.
      
         
         
              I praise and glorify my gracious Father of heaven which gives me
          such pious and religious advice to direct me how to take these trials
           and to suffer patiently the will of God, which he can order for my
           spiritual good, even that which the devil and my enemies intends to
           destroy me by; for whenever he stirs up malice, my God stirs
           up his servants to yield me comforts and vindication of his widow.

           May the 17, 1669, being a just half year after the marriage
           of my dear child and eldest daughter, Alice Thornton, did I
          invite all our nearest relations and Mr Thornton's friends, which
        
           we could get, to as handsome an entertainment as I could be able
           to procure, considering my own still weakness and ill habit of health:
         
               brother Denton and my sister; my brother Portington and my
                sister; Mr Charles Man, the fortunate person who married them, and
          many other good friends and neighbours.
      
         
              All who expressed their great satisfaction at the solemnity and
          making the publication of this marriage and wished the young couple
           many hearty joys in their marriage, saying they hoped it would,
           by God's blessing, be a great happiness and comfort to us all. At night
          they had also a good supper, and those usual solemnities of a
          marriage of getting the bride to bed, with a great deal of decency
           and modesty of all parties, was thus this solemnity performed.
           I bless God, he, letting me live to see this great concern of my
          life performed, with such friends' satisfaction which wished myself
           and poor child well and that by God's blessing may be prospered in his
           fear. We, having solemn prayers twice that day to beg a particular

           And I humbly poured out my prayers, petitions and humble supplications
           to the great <span class="quote">God of heaven to have mercy on them</span>, and to give them
          the choicest of his graces and divine spirit to be over them in all spiritual
            
           blessings and temporal, and give them such a blessing of children as may be

         a blessing to us and make them heirs of eternal life to fulfil his
           kingdom, and to be a comfort to this poor, despised family and me, a
          <span class="quote">desolate widow</span>, and to establish the church in this place and
           family to all generations. All which I humbly beg, and whatever else
           it seems good in the eyes of my gracious God, <span class="quote">for Jesus Christ, his
             sake</span>, getting all humble thanks and praise, and <span class="quote">glory and honour</span>
          to the great God of mercy which has brought this to pass and has
          not suffered me to perish but preserved us to this great end.
           And will, I hope, confound our malicious enemies, or bring them
           to conversion for our Lord Jesus Christ, his sake. Amen. Amen. Amen.

           In regard I was so odiously blasphemed in my honour
            
        and reputation (which I no ways deserved, I bless God) but for the good
          ends my dear friends has declared the reasons of this match
          in my vindication from hell and his accomplices. I am also in duty
           obliged (both towards God, my guide, and all my own vindication)
           to give all my absent friends, who might unhappily have heard
          the clamours of my enemies, but what was the truth of my condition (or what great reasons and inducements

               
             I was under to
           finish this match so soon, or indeed accept of the first motion)
          they had not received an account of until now.
         
           Therefore, that I might use all lawful and commendable means
           to do myself and the truth right in this concern of so great merit,
           as the marriage of my dearest child, which I hope providentially
          is disposed to Mr Comber, and will in time so appear to the whole
          world. I have writ to my absent friends of it after the full
           consummation of the marriage and publication thereof. (May 17, 1669.)
      
         
    
         
           I writ to my good friend, Mr Ranald Graham, at London,
          to give him a full account of proceedings and what conditions I
           was left in to by debts, who was truly sensible of my sufferings
           as appeared in his letter to my uncle William, when he writ to him
           to get my husband's bond from him. My letter dated, June 20, 1669.
         
         
         
         
           Two letters of mine, the copies of them also extant, to my
           Lady Yorke after publication to that same effect; she, being so
          much concerned to break the match upon false lies and suggestion
           of my bitter and malicious enemies, was, upon more serious thoughts
           and true information, much afflicted for my wrongs and highly
          satisfied with all our honest proceedings.
      
         
         
    
         
              My letter also to my good niece Fairfax found great
           acceptance with her, nor had she ever a misdeeming thought of me
           or any concerned but wished us all imaginable joy and comfort.
           These dated June 21, 1669.
         
         
    
         
           Received a condoling letter from my niece of my husband's
           loss and my sickness and sorrows, and her good opinion of Mr Comber,

         who was esteemed an understanding and ingenious person, and
           may do very well in the marriage of my daughter, wishing all
           joy and comfort in them. (June 23, 1669.)
         
         
    <span class="event" id="ev222-start">
         
           It pleased God in his great mercy and goodness to myself,
           and my son and daughter, to be made partakers of that holy
           feast of our Lord and saviour, Jesus Christ, of the blessed Sacrament
          at Easter 1669, being the second time I received after Mr Thornton's
           death and after the marriage of my daughter.
      </span>
         
         
           Blessed be the gracious God of mercy, who has vouchsafed to
          give us this holy food of his precious body to heal all our wounds
           and give us the assurance of eternal life with him. O Lord, grant us
           grace to walk answerably to thy means of salvation, and accept
          of our true repentance and vows of all new obedience for thy bitter
          passion sake. Amen. Amen.
