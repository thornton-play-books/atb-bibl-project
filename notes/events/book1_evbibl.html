                 by some beams of his mercy, in putting good thoughts into my mind to consider his great and miraculous
                 power in the creation of the heavens, the earth and all

                 upon the reading of the daily psalms for the months:
                happening that day to be Psalm 14:4:
            
                
            <span class="evquote">He counteth the stars and calleth them all by their
                 names</span>.
                  From whence there came into my heart
                 a forcible consideration of the incomprehensible
                 power and infinite majesty of Almighty God, <span class="evquote">who
                 by his wisdom made all things in heaven and earth,</span>

                 me into a deep fear and great awe of his <span class="evquote">glorious

                <span class="evquote">sin against him</span> or my parents. And he would punish all
                 sins: were they never so many as the stars, yet
                 he was as well able to keep an account and punish for them
                 as to <span class="evquote">tell the stars and give them names.</span>
            (This, with other, the like meditations of his omnipotence

                the welfare and eternal happiness and salvation

                 good performances towards my education in all
                things; begging of God to give me the grace of the
                 means (as well as <span class="quote">the means of his grace</span>) afforded

                While we were in Dublin, there was a fire in
                our house but, by the providence of God, it was

            About the time I was 12 years old, in the year 1638,
                 I was reading of the great wisdom of our saviour
                 in the Gospel of St Luke, second chapter, 49th verse, <span class="evquote">where he was
                 disputing with the doctors with so much power that he put them
                 to silence.</span>
            In the reading of which passage, I, being that day 12 years
                 old, I fell into a serious and deep meditation of the
                 thoughts of Christ's majesty, divinity and wisdom,
                who was able to confound the learned doctors and confute
                their wisdom — who were aged —  he, being so young
                 himself, but then 12 years of age.
            And then I considered my own folly and childish
                 ignorance that I could not scarce understand mean
                 and low things without a great deal of teaching
                 and instruction, and although I daily read the word
                 of God yet was of a weak capacity to know <span class="evquote">the way
                to salvation</span>. And, therefore, in my heart begged of
                 my dear saviour to give me <span class="evquote">knowledge, wisdom
                 and understanding</span> to guide me all my days. Amen.</span>

            Having come over into England, when my mother
                 came for her cure of the disease of the stone to the baths
                and Bristol water, St Vincent's Well (upon which rock,
                 hanging over it, is got your Bristol diamonds),</span><span class="event" id="ev12-start">in
                 her return back into Ireland, she carried my
                     sister Danby's two eldest sons for their better
                 education. When we came to Neston, at the sea-side, we stayed for a wind a week and in that time
                there was a great storm on the sea insomuch as
                 there was five ships cast away upon the shore before
                 our eyes: so nigh were some of them that the main
                 mast did almost touch the window of that house
                 where we laid. Yet, the night proving calm
                 and wind fair, we took ship for Ireland (in
                one of the king's ships new built) upon the 22nd of
                     August 1639. Within one hour's sail, a most 
                 terrible storm and tempest arose so fiercely that 
                 we were drove on lee all night, and within less than 10
                 hours we were 12 miles beyond Dublin, lying at
                     hull and anchor all day. And, but for a fisher boat
                sent from Mr Hubert to assist the king's ship in distress,
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.16&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 16</a>



            
                 
            
            we had undoubtedly perished, being drove by
                the force of tempest back into the cross seas (and 
                 10 hours were at anchor, beaten on the sands, 
                before that fisherman could come near to help us).
                 At the last, about eight o'clock at night, we got safe
                to harbour
                through the infinite mercies of our great and powerful
                 Lord God. We landed safely at the shore of the Skerries,
                 where the same Hubert, with all his family and friends,
                 met us with great joy, entertaining my mother and
                 all hers with abundant affection and kindness.
                 Which he did upon the account of obligation to show
                 his gratitude for an eminent piece of justice
                 done him from my father, who had decided a
                 grand controversy in lawsuits, which was depending
                 20 years almost to his utter ruin. His adversary
                 being so potent that he could not get his cause heard
                 until that time, when — through the uprightness of the 
                judge and honesty of the man — his cause rightly determined , and he preserved.
            
                This providence was the more remarkable that God
                 so ordered our ship to this shore where my mother
                 found all manner of relief for us all, which we wanted.
                And, on the next day, came my father from Dublin
                 in the company of many noble friends in coaches

                The Earl of Strafford was sent for by the king into England, upon the complaints of some factious
                spirits, weary of a lawful and peaceable government
                 both in England, Scotland and Ireland, whose
                 spirits and ambitions could not endure a subjection

            and dignities, the settlement of the church and state
                upon the right foundations of truth and peace — which 
                these people had no such intentions, as was too
                apparent in the following rebellions both in England
                 and Ireland. The Irish being heard to say that their
                 religion would not prosper as long as Strafford's
                 head stood on his shoulders, which saying strongly
                proved that this noble earl was no patron of the 
                 Romish church, although falsely accused so by
                 his seditious enemies. And his own innocency was
                cleared upon the scaffold in his speech made then.
                 But all the discontented parties too well agreed in this one
                point: to strike the root of the foundations, the king
                being aimed at, to succeed in this tragedy as God
                 knows too sadly followed.
            The Earl of Strafford — having far different designs
                than those secret plotters of rapine and ruin —
                 could no longer be endured because he stood in the
                 way to hinder and prevent by his wise counsel. So 
                that, until he was removed, they could not prevail either
                 in Ireland or England to compass their ends;
                 nor could there be found a better expedient for their 
                 purpose than to make a cloak of religion that under
                 such a popular, specious pretence their horrible
                 practices might not be found out.

            The Irish, thirsting after the blood and lives of the 
                 English, pretended oppression to be made subject
                to the laws of England, and the other of that nation (who could
                 not be subject to our church government and orders, but affected a loose libertinism to their
                 own pernicious ways) joined with the Irish in
                 their complaints against this wise and noble
                     person —whom indeed they were not worthy of—
                under whose jurisdiction that kingdom had enjoyed seven years of peace and plenty: all his
                 endeavours ever tending for their good; the
                 true establishment of his king and religion;
                the honour, peace and welfare of the English nation;
                 and the due ordering of that barbarous people
                 and their civilising them to our good laws and
                 government. But this was against all their
                 interests of rebellions and close-couched treacheries
                 which lay hatched under so specious pretensions
                 that he would subvert the church and state.

                 and destruction of church and state, to advance

            horrible parricides and murders, breaking forth
                 first in Ireland to the destruction of millions of the 
                 poor protestant Christians who suffered martyrdom
                 for their God and his religion.
             And in England many thousands suffered by the sword,
                both with their king and for him and the truth of
                 religion there established and for the laws.
            But, to return to my Lord Lieutenant: while the
                 pretences of religion so filled the ears of the parliament
                of England then sitting in the year 1640, and false
                 suggestions of oppressions against this noble
                 earl, he was called before them to give an answer
                to such articles as his enemies of all factions
                 had unjustly laid to his charge.
            The whole transaction of this business was prosecuted with so much malice and rigour of his enemies'
                 side, and so much wisdom, prudence and gallantry
                 on the earl's that all the world (save his enemies thirsting
                 his blood) did admire his incomparable wisdom and
                 abilities in his clear and brave defence he made for 
                 himself (notwithstanding they gave fresh charges each
                 day which he had never heard of, nor had he any time
                 spared to give in his answer, but was set upon with
                new bloodhounds as their fancies pleased).

            Neither was he allowed the benefit of his witnesses
                 only. There was that in his trial done which was never
                 heard of before: for want of full evidence against
                 him (which was screwed to the height too) an invention 
                forged of accumulative treason and a particular
                act made in that parliament to confirm the same
                 until they had got his life.
            And then another following act, after his death, to abrogate and disannul the other forever that it might
                 never be in force against any other person.
                 The world may by this judge the truth and legality
                 of these proceedings against this brave person.
                 But the truth is, he had so much of wrong and 
                 injustice done in all the prosecution, as no man
                but of infinite abilities (which God had wonderfully
                 given him) could have withstood those mastiffs
                 and bloodhounds in the quick retorts and vindication
                 of his innocent actions, returning their malice
                 on their own false suggestions.
            So that, lest these articles and other artifices in
                the house should not prevail with the king (who did
                 clear him in his own judgement) there was the
                 invention of abundance of lies, and calumnies
                 cast about and instilled into the ears and hearts of the

            vulgar, meaner people, such as had ignorance
                and pride to be their leaders; which, being told a 
                falsehood — that the lord lieutenant did counsel the king
                to subvert the laws and bring in popery — gathered
                together in infinite numbers of prentices of London
                and headstrong separates and schismatics.
           
            The great numbers meeting at the parliament house,
                daily clamoured and cried out against my lord and
                the king, did so increase that the tumults had nigh to
                 have pulled his sacred majesty in pieces as he
                 removed from Whitehall to the parliament, still
                 crying out for justice against Strafford.
            
             So that, to satisfy their cruel malice and to give
                 them all content, there was no other expedient
                 would do but this innocent earl's life to be
                 taken from him.
            This the most pious king could very hardly be
                 drawn to, being pressed to sign the bill (he still
                declaring his innocency, in his conscience, he was not
                worthy of death). But the king, being constrained
                 for the safeguard of his own life, passed that fatal
                bill, with two others that day, which proved as destructive
                to him and the church and kingdom, as this of Strafford's:
 that of excluding the bishops out of the house of
                parliament and the other of triennial parliaments,

            which were preludiums of this most excellent
                king's own destruction, when the commons had got
                the reins of power by this into their own hand
                and the better capacitated to fight against their
                 lawful sovereign; albeit they pulled upon themselves and the kingdom a fatal ruin within a few
                 years after, but principally against our
                 sacred majesty which was the mark with the crown
                 which they aimed at.
            But this gallant earl, so much desiring the
                peace and happiness of his majesty and kingdoms,
                did acquit the king constrained and cheerfully
                 submitted to that sentence with so much serenity and
                 tranquillity of thoughts as is imaginable. Only
                 did justify his innocency to the death as maybe
                seen in his papers and last speech. He forgave his
                adversaries and wished, as he was the first that had
                 laid down his life in this way for the preservation
                of the king and church, so that he might be the last innocent bloodshed. But he much feared it.
            He put up prayers for the king and the whole kingdom
                 as it may be seen in his trial, written by an eye and
                 ear witness. And upon the 12th of May 1641,
                 he suffered martyrdom, being beheaded on

                infinite loss to the church of God, his king and the 
                 three kingdoms: who, through his wise counsel,
                 the same had been fortunate to the preservation of peace and truth

                began to break out again that had appeared in the year 1639.
                 And our sins, contracted in so long a peace, was ripe
                 for judgements: God's sword was drawn out against us to fight his quarrel, until by our punishments
                 he humbled the pride of our hearts.

          In his time, there were many causes determined
                 and decided of great concernment between parties
                 which had depended some 10, 20, 30 years, and the
                 cause of the widows and oppressed, strangers and
                 the fatherless was rightly adjudged and determined,
           which through the imbecility of the parties, the power
                 of the adversaries or corruption of the under-officers
       had been until then neglected. But to the comfort
                 of the injured was rightly settled, and also to the satisfaction of the other parties, who, being convinced
              by the pains and Christian advices and wise, just
                 managery of his government, they confessed
                 the equity of his determinations to be just,

                 and state, such was the sins and pride of those days
                 that there hung a cloud over these kingdoms.
                 He prayed God to divert the same and establish

                 rest himself a little in his bedchamber, intending

            The entertainment in his sickness was full of
                 divine meditations, ejaculations and prayers, with
                 praises to his God and preparations for death.
            He gave many instructions to his son, George, to be
                 diligent in the service of God, obedient to his commandment;
                obedient  and dutiful to his dear mother, who had
                 been a faithful, tender, loving wife to him and his
                     children; he commanded him to love, honour, obey her
                 in all things, all his days, due to her for her wisdom
                 and virtue, and doing this, God would bless him the better;
                 charged him to suffer his will to be performed which
                 was just and equal, there being right done to him
                 and all persons else; ending with many good advices
                 to fear and love that dreadful Lord God, and he would
                 bless him and provide for him as he had done to himself.
                 When he laid slumbering, still would he be as if
                 discoursing in judicature that he would do uprightly
                to all in his power if the poor man's cause be right,
                 he should not suffer for his poverty, nor the rich gain
                 for being so if his cause were bad; neither could
                 he respect the persons of the rich or poor but do uprightly according to the laws of God and man.</span>

          Many such like expressions I have heard him
                 myself; then would he call on me to his bedside, and steadily looking on me would sigh
                 and say, 'Ah, poor child, what must thou see
                 and thine eyes behold'. And, praying for me,
                 turned away with a great groan,
           which expressions stuck so deep that I never forgot them but has sadly experienced

          The Bishop of Derry being called on Thursday at
                 night, who told him he perceived he grew weaker
                 in body that he would do well to declare in
              public his faith and hope in God, not that he questioned the same (he, being fully satisfied)
                 but that it was usual in those cases for the comfort
                 and instruction of the company.
            Immediately, my dear father raised up
                himself with all his force, and steadfastly fixed his eyes to heaven, then made (before many
                persons of quality, with my mother) a most
                 heavenly and pathetically confession of his faith,
                 hope and confidence in God. And that his heart did
                 fully rely upon the all-saving merits of Jesus
                 Christ, his redeemer; in him alone, hoped for pardon
                and remission of all his sins and for salvation through
                his blood, which was shed for him,

          and that, in him, he hoped for eternal glory of his
                 own free grace and mercy. He desired the Lord to forgive all his sins as he freely forgave all the 
              world and declaring that he died in the faith
                 which was professed in the Church of England at that time,
              being most pure and holy and agreeing with Christ's
                 institution, praying to God long to continue it
                 flourishing.
          Many other prayers for himself and his wife and
                 children, desiring to be accepted of the Lord in
                 mercy, according to the sincerity of his heart.
              After devout prayers for him by the bishop and the solemn
                 pronunciation of absolution in order to the church's
                 command, this dear and sweet saint freely
                 yielded up his precious soul to God, with these
                 words: '<span class="evquote">into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my soul</span>.
                 Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. Amen'.
          
          With which he fell asleep, which blessed end of his life,
              being a happy close of his holy life, has (I hope) received
                 a full reward of joy in the kingdom of heaven and
                 struck a most deep impression upon all that knew
                 him. I pray the Lord continue his memory fresh in
                 my heart to imitate his virtues, graces and piety.
                 He departed this life on Thursday the 3rd of December

                 much study and business which his weighty and

            The corpse of my honoured father was carried from
                 the castle of Dublin in a stately manner, according
                 to his dignity and place, being interred in the
                 chief church, Christ's Church, under a fair
                marble before the deputy's seat of estate
                on the 10th day of December 1640.
          The Bishop of Derry preached his funeral sermon
             
              and I am sure amongst the multitude of people
                 there was not many dry eyes: such was the love
                 that God had given to this worthy person that the Irish
                 did set up their lamentable hone (as they call
                 it) for him in the church which was never known
                 before for any Englishman done.
          
          
    
          His funeral's charges did amount to above £1300,
              dying in that capacity of a deputy, which so increased the debts upon his estate as proved very
                heavy in the times of trouble succeeding. The king
                 did give order that this should have been discharged
              out of his treasury, as also that my brother George's
                 wardship was given him by his gracious majesty,
                 both in regard of my father's faithful service in that 
                 place and his dying deputy. But the parliament
              seizing upon the king's treasury and power, these 
                 charges fell sad upon all my father's estate and his
                 children, being charged for the wardship by the parliament
              with the sum of £2500  which never came to the king.</span>

            Thus, was it— in the time of this prophet, Isaiah— when
                 God had a controversy with his people of Israel, denouncing and threatening his judgements against them
                by this and others of his prophets, yet would they not
                 hear nor return.
            Then did he move them by his sweetest mercies, 
                 those was in vain: how long shall I call and ye will
                 not answer? And all the day long, <span class="quote">I have stretched
                 out my hand to a gainsaying people: these will not
                 move</span>. And now, he sends his last warning pieces
                that they might take notice he was bringing 
                 great evils upon them for the hardness of their
                 hearts: this was the sign.
            <span class="quote">The righteous perisheth</span>; yea, they perish from off
                 this earth. But what do they lose that loseth
                 a righteous man? A holy man from their place,
                 whose souls and bodies has been kept from impiety
                and pollutions of this world, the flesh and the devil which
                 are true Israelites indeed; pouring out daily
                 their petitions and prayers to God for the kingdom,
                place and families and, <span class="quote">with Moses, stood before the people
                 to turn away his wrathful displeasure against
                 them with strong cries and tears to God to spare his
                 people from destruction</span>. 
            Great are the benefits which are enjoyed in the life and
                 examples, prayers and supplications, government and
                 instructions of a holy, righteous king, father,

                master or ruler over any kingdom, place or family and
                 then the loss is more eminent and general to that society.
                 The death of the least of God's servants are heavy afflictions,
                 <span class="quote">but when the tall cedars falls greater is the blow to
                     the shrubs under whose branches was their shelter</span>.
                The head being off, how can the other members subsist?
                 Too frequently follows confusion.
            Yet, the prophet tells us from God, <span class="quote">no man lays it to
                 heart</span> to consider why doth God this, nor are sensible
                 of this <span class="quote">sign of wrath</span> that they may repent of their
                 sins which has provoked his anger against them.
                 God saith more: <span class="quote">the merciful men are taken away
                 too</span>, as if this gift of mercy were of more use to them
                 as to their good than any other virtue.
            A great loss indeed and to be particularly lamented
                 by us: when mercy perisheth from off the earth (as 
                 from God to man) those people are miserable.
            Take away that glorious attribute of mercy from God — 
                by which the world was made, preserved and upholden from
                us — there remains justice and severity, with an almighty power to fall upon us men to the destruction of soul and
                 body. Who can endure the justice of the Lord when his wrath
                 doth arise? Yea, but a <span class="quote">twinkling of an eye</span>. Who is able to
                 stand before him? So, when merciful men is taken from
                 amongst us many times tyranny, oppression and injustice
                 follows. Yea, when a father, the glory of the wood is cut down,

            what remains amongst men when an unmerciful
                 man is ruler over them, but expectations to be devoured
                  and torn asunder through avarice, pride, factions,
                self-interest and what not? Even all confusion in 
                 such a kingdom, place or family.
            And, without an infinite mercy to prevent, will proceed to utter destruction; yet, the fears of this will not
                 rouse this secure people out of the lethargy of sin.
                 <span class="quote">When these righteous perish,</span> yet will they not consider when it is done to warn them of their own ruin that
                 merciful men go; nor will awaken to look about
                     and inquire, by the word,  of the cause of God's dealing

                 and so, by that means, be converted that he should

            As it was with the stubborn Jews, so it is our own
                 case, God knows, in these kingdoms. Our sins
                 were ripe for to be cut down by the <span class="quote">sickle of God's
                     judgements</span> by our enemies, and for them to fall on this kingdom
                 whose bloody desires had so far besotted their hearts that
                 were upon a speedy execution of their designs.
                All whose secret intentions God saw and, that my
                 father's soul was grieved for the iniquities of the times,
                 delivered him from the following miseries by a quiet,
                 peaceable and sweet departure in the Lord.

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.43&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 43</a>



            
            According to his word, he was taken away. But from
                what or why doth God cut short the life of his servant?
                Not in anger, surely, against them, although it is said
                 in this text, '<span class="quote">the righteous perisheth</span>'? 
            No, he perisheth from the pleasures of the world and the delights
                 thereof (for the present enjoyments of this life) that he might
                 translate him to a better place and more durable riches.
                 And not only so, but their departure was to be freed
                 even from the evils to come.
            Well might this be applied to our very case, in my 
                 dear father's deliverance: for his eyes did not see
                those great and terrible evils which we did that survived him,
                  even bitter ones that fell upon the whole English and Irish
                 nations, such as was never heard of the like (such horrid
                 treasons, treacheries, bloodsheds, burnings, famines,
                desolations and destructions).
            Which fell so heavily upon our holy, good and pious
                king, whom the world was not worthy of, and that excellent,
                 pure and glorious church then established (for soundness
                in faith and doctrine none could parallel since the apostles'
                 time).  And surely these things was foreseen 
                 several years before by him: he laid out his endeavours
                 to prevent the falling of them upon us by his frequent
                 admonishments and reproofs for their vanities,
                 with his zealous prayers and deep humiliation of his person
                 and daily intercessions at the <span class="quote">throne of grace</span> for these
                     three kingdoms,

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.44&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 44</a>



            
                
            
            but, our sins crying so loud in general for
                vengeance, that the Lord would not spare those which
                 offended with so high a hand against the sweet
                 mercies and forbearance of our gracious God.
                Yet, notwithstanding all those calamities and distractions of those times, I must ever acknowledge 
                 and set forth the loving kindness, mercies and goodness
                 of the Lord of Hosts to us in our deliverances in all
                 these troubles: he making <span class="quote">places of refuge</span> for
                my father's wife and children, 
            <span class="quote">so that not a hair of our heads perished</span> in the
                general destructions either by the Irish or English
                rebellions. In Ireland were we miraculously
                 preserved in Dublin for several weeks after the
                rebellion was broken out in the country.
                 And though in much frights by alarms from
                 the enemies, yet were we delivered from those
                 evils <span class="event" id="ev26-start">until — by a safe passage into England with
                 all my mother's family and goods with her at
                Dublin — we got quit of Ireland and got to the
                 Beer House at Neston.</span>
            Thus, was there a sanctuary from those perils
                 for this righteous man's family when thousands was
                swallowed up in the common calamities of that 
                 kingdom by the Irish papists. And so also,
            

                <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.45&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 45</a>



                
                 
            
                thus did the Lord deliver my dear father in this
                 way, the best of all: most certainly it was, for
                 there the weary be at rest and <span class="quote">the wicked cease from troubling </span>. He died and was gathered to his Father's in a 
                quiet and peaceable time; as he lived in peace, so
                 he departed in peace and to peace, <span class="quote">giving him rest in his
                sleep: the sweet sleep of death</span> to him though sad 
                 to us he left behind him.
            It follows in the second verse: <span class="quote">He shall enter into peace:
                 they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in
                 his uprightness</span>.
            When the righteous man leaves this turbulent
                 world, whither shall he go or what place has
                 God prepared for him? Lo, the spirit of God tells
                us by his prophet here the place: <span class="quote">he shall enter
                    into peace, they shall rest in their beds</span>.
            And in this change of my father was fulfilled
                 this prophecy, which had been confirmed by our dear
                 saviour's <span class="quote">blessings to the peacemakers, the poor in
                spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven; to the
                 meek, to the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy;
                 to the pure in heart, for they shall see God; the peacemakers , for they shall be called the children of 
                     God</span>.

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.46&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 46</a>



            
                
            
            Several of these graces — if not all of them — 
                 this dear servant of God was eminent for; in whose
                 blessings, I trust, he enjoys his share; being called
                 by God to work in his vineyard young, he fitted
                 him for his place here that he might obtain
                 a crown in heaven hereafter.
            Many received a blessing in his peaceable and
                 meek, humble frame of heart; being a great means
                and instrument of reconciliation in his time to public and private families, which were partakers of the
                 benefits received thereby. 
            Therefore, I hope in that God of peace, whose servant
                he was, that he now also rests himself. In his death,
                 he shall enter into peace; they shall rest in their
                beds; their grave shall be a bed of honour. To him,
                 it is so: <span class="quote">blessed with a good fame and name which is like
                 the savour of sweet and precious ointment, as Solomon
                 the wise saith</span>. He, serving the Lord here a few days, is
                 blessed with this precious odour forever: <span class="quote">the name of
                 the just shall live forever</span>.
            Each one, walking in his uprightness — the merciful,
                the just, the upright, the holy, the righteous man — all
                have their abundant blessings (Matthew 5).

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.47&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 47</a>



            
                
            
            And these fell upon the head of this good Josiah,
                 whom the Lord had such care of to deliver him from
                 those evils following his death: in that his eyes
                 did not behold the evils which he brought upon this land.
                 In all these things, we have cause to bless our
                gracious and heavenly Father in fulfilling his word
                to him that is in this text.
            Making him happy in his name and memory to posterity, living happily here and dying in the peace
                 of God and with all the world: peace at home and abroad;
                 in his own conscience and soul abundance of tranquillity,
                 having walked uprightly all his days; and now
                this diligent labourer of God was, at last, called
                 by his Lord and has received of him his hire,
             even the wages of eternal glory, with his Lord and God to
                 behold that fair beauty and <span class="quote">see him face to face</span>
                 and live with him forever. Now <span class="quote">mortality has put on
                 immortality</span> to <span class="quote">follow the Lamb wherever he goes</span>,
                receiving that blessed doom of him, in Matthew 25:34:
                <span class="quote">Come, ye blessed of my Father's</span> and <span class="quote">thou hast been faithful over a few things: enter thou into the joy of
                 thy Lord</span>.
            Thus, have we seen that God is able and frequently
                 doth make it appear that the death of the righteous
                 servants of God are exceeding great blessings, and a
                 happiness to themselves when he gathereth them
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.48&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 48</a>



            
                 
            
            sooner from the wicked, preserving them safe in
                 the grave from all violencies and outrages, both of
                 sin and sufferings, and giving into their bosoms
                 a hundred times more the reward of his grace 
                with glory everlasting. Peradventure, on the contrary,
                 when as their deaths may prove a curse to
                 the world to be left of such <span class="quote">Moseses and Samuels
                (which pleaded to God for them)</span> and whose deaths are
                 too often forerunners of fatal judgements to
                 all hard hearted and incorrigible sinners.
            The Lord God of mercy, grant to us all of his
                family that this grand blow, in taking our
                head from us, may be a warning to fear and serve
                this great God of our father's; returning from those
                evil ways and sins which has offended him, <span class="quote">lest
                 we perish by iniquity</span>. Learn by our father's
                 example to imitate his virtues, being in peace
                 and unity amongst ourselves that so, living in truth
                 and peace, we may at last enjoy the God of peace. Amen.

                 to be displeased and to take my dear father from my
                 head. In whose welfare and life, my good and happiness
                 in this life did consist, and very much conduced to
                 my eternal concerns and good of my poor ignorant
                 soul. By whose providence, care and wisdom, I have
                 been upheld, succoured and maintained under thee

                things are necessary for my salvation: he, being
                a grand instrument of good to all us, his children.
                O Lord, forgive all our follies and sins against thyself

            to take her away from us also and so make ourselves miserable. Let us reform of our vanities,

                 the blessings of this life and those spiritual, together
                 with the happy opportunities thou gavest to my
                 dear father to serve thee in his generations by
                 a happy success in all his weighty callings.
            The good providence and prudence by which he added
                 more improvements to his estate than his progenitors
                 for his justice, uprightness, mercifulness, charity
                 to his relations and strangers in general.
            For the favour and good will thou gavest him in his
                 own and a strange country, and for all the good wherever thou enabled him to do either for our souls
                 or bodies. These blessings, I humbly acknowledge,
                 did alone proceed from thy divine goodness from
                 whence comes <span class="quote">every good and perfect gift</span>.
            Therefore, O Lord, I beseech, accept my gratitude and praise
                for all, and as thy mercy has been so plentifully
                 bestowed to this family, add this one thing more to
                 us: that all thy dispensations may be sanctified to us
                 in giving us grace to live accordingly and may be <span class="quote">a
                holy people, as the redeemed of the Lord</span>,

            <span class="quote">not being stubborn and rebellious</span> by dishonouring
                 thy majesty, <span class="quote">but as lights shining to a perverse
                 people amongst whom we live</span> even to the salvation
                 of our precious souls in the day of the Lord Jesus.
            Lord, I pray thee also, endue me with patience and
                 humility to sustain this thy hand of punishment
                 to me by the departure of my father and, like a Christian,
                 learn betimes to follow my saviour, even when thou
                 shalt call for all those comforts I have if that shall
                 seem good for me in thy eyes. Season my youth with
                 true principles of piety and holiness that whether
                 prosperity or adversity, afflictions or crosses,
                 poverty or a competency thou shalt please to give
                 me to enjoy in this life, I may so devote myself to thy
                 service <span class="quote">that I may learn to see thee in all things
                 and enjoy all things in thee</span>; not seeking my happiness
                 in this world, <span class="quote">may take up my cross daily to follow
                 my sweet saviour</span>, dedicating my youth in all 
                 obedience and filial duty to thy commands and my
                 virtuous mother's, being a comfort and stay in her
                 weakness, and at her dispose in the Lord in all things.
            That thus, spending my days according to thy word,
                 when I come at my end, I may rejoice in thy salvation
                 and live eternally in thy presence, and <span class="quote">glorifying
                 the blessed and glorious Trinity</span> with delight and joy forever. And these most humble petitions I crave for the
                 Lord Jesus Christ's sake, my dear saviour.
            Amen. Amen.

            O eternal, omnipotent and most merciful Father,
                 thou that openest and <span class="quote">no man shutteth, and shuttest
                 and no man openeth</span>, <span class="quote">let the words of our mouths
                 and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in thy
                     sight</span> this time and for evermore.
            O Lord God, by whom we were created at the
                first, <span class="quote">by whom we now live, move and have our
                 being</span>, look not upon us as we were placed at the
                first by thy divine power in the state of perfection, adorned with those heavenly qualities
                 of knowledge and freedom of will whereby we
                 had some resemblance of thee, our great Creator;
                 neither as we lie in the loins of our first
                   
                 parents
                who, <span class="quote">by eating that sour grape, hath set an edge
                 upon our teeth</span>; <span class="quote">much less as we are defiled with
                 our own pollutions and uncleanness</span>. But behold us,
                 we beseech thee, in that state which thy divine providence, <span class="quote">through the redemption of thy son and our
                saviour, Christ Jesus</span>, hath prepared for our restoration unto that happiness from whence we are fallen
                that so, we — who were altogether dead of ourselves —
                  may, by him, be recovered unto that everlasting resurrection, which thou (that wishest the perfection and continuance of what thou hast made) hast prepared for us before
                the beginning of the world, <span class="quote">if we fear thee and keep</span>

                <span class="quote">thy commandments</span>. Now seeing, O Lord, such
                 misery hath accrued unto us by the act of the first
                 Adam, we humbly desire that we may take hold of
                 the covenant of thy free grace which the second Adam hath
                 prepared for us, and that we may evermore magnify thy
                 great and unspeakable mercies in sending thine only 
                son to become man for us,<span class="quote"> who (being without sin)
                suffered for sin that we (who were nothing but sin</span>)
                 might be made rich by the imputation of his all sufficient
                 righteousness. But, dear Father, such are our infirmities that we have been so far from acknowledging
                 thy infinite goodness towards us in sending thy only
                 son to redeem us when we were utterly lost; so far
                 from being thankful to him for his inexpressible love
                 towards us that <span class="quote">was content to suffer death, even the
                 scornful death of the cross for our sakes</span>; so far from the 
                 participation of his virtues or the imitation of his holiness and examples, that those laws  which —either by the
                 instinct of nature (a guide even unto unreasonable
                 creatures) or by divine precept thou hast charactered
                in our hearts —we have, as much as lay in our power, raised
                 out by adding actual unto original sins. So that those
                 wounds of his, which our tears should have cleansed, our
                 sins have enlarged; those stripes of his, which our penitence
                 should have healed, our iniquities have reiterated;
                 and those scoffings, railings and unjust calumniations
                 of his adversaries have been augmented by our neglect
                of those duties and offices of piety, which we — by his example
                and precept — should have performed to others, insomuch
                 that we have crucified thee again, our heavenly saviour,
                 by our impenitent and unprofitable lives.

            Wherefore, though at all times we ought to acknowledge our sins before God —thee, who <span class="quote">being a
                 righteous Lord, lovest righteousness and whose countenance will behold the thing that is just</span> — yet, at this
                 time, we desire thy especial assistance in confessing
                 ourselves before the <span class="quote">throne of thy grace</span> (and justice)
                uprightly and necessarily, where  by thy grace we
                 desire to participate of the  body and blood of our most
                 dear and merciful saviour because otherwise we 
                 shall be guilty of our own damnation.
            
                
                
                
                        
                We do, therefore, O Lord, confess, that we have
                        converted that acknowledging thee for our true and only
                God (as thou commandest by <span class="quote">fearing thy name</span>, loving
                 thee above all creatures both in heaven and earth,
                 humbling ourselves before thee, <span class="quote">being patient to
                 endure what thou sendest</span> and hopeful only in thee)
                 into an ignorance of thy divine will; a carnal 
                 security and contempt of thee; a halting and counterfeit love of thee; as well as an inordinate love of ourselves and others; an hypocritical trust in thee; an
                 outward and counterfeit humility; an impatience
                and murmuring against thee; lastly, into a final
                 desperation or presumption.
            
            
                
                
              
                Neither, O Lord, have we attributed that honour and
                  glory to thy divine majesty which became us, but instead of images and idols — which thou hast forbidden —
                we have given that honour
                 and pre-eminence to our
                 wills, lust, our own desires,  our own imaginations 
                 which have made ourselves liable to thy reproach and
                indignation, insomuch that we cannot expect but
                 that thy justice should be intended

             against us and our generations after us forever.
           
               
               
                 
               But so guilty have we been, O Lord, of taking thy holy
            name in our mouths in vain, that we have not only 
            neglected that duty of honouring
                 and reverencing thy glorious
                 name by invocation, prayer and thanksgiving; the acknowledgment and publication of thy praises; the glorifying
                 of thy holy name upon all occasions, but by railings,
                 bannings, cursings, blasphemies, maledictions and
                 imprecations, we have profaned thy great name by 
                 forswearing, false swearing, light and common swearing,
                 foolish calling thee to witness, rash vows, wiles, deceit,
 lies and such like untruths vainly dishonoured thy
                 great and glorious name.
            
                
                
                
                And whereas, like a merciful Father, thou hast provided
                 six days for our necessaries and reserved but one for thy
                
                sabbath — wherein thou hast enjoined us a frequent use
                 of thy worship, as well in public congregations as by
                 ourselves; an attentive hearing thy word and works and
                 meditating upon both; a frequent use of thy Sacraments;
                
                
                 a charitable disposition to thy poor members whom
                 thou hast left here among us, in visiting the sick and
                comforting the afflicted and relieving the poor — we have
                 contrarily absented ourselves from thy service and worship;
                 contemned thy ministry and Sacraments; neglected the hearing
                 and reading of thy scriptures; and, instead of prayers, deeds of
                 piety, mercy and charity, we have intermeddled with profane
                and ordinary affairs of those days.
            
                
                
                
                But, alas, dear <span class="quote">Father of mercies</span>, we are not only guilty
                of offending thee, our heavenly Father, but have broken
                those bonds and obligations which common civility and
                 humanity hath appointed betwixt us and our
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.58&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 58</a>



            
                 
            
            neighbours: for we be commanded to provide for
                 our inferiors by embracing them with a fatherly
                 affection, by providing for their maintenance and
                 education; by instructing them in the fear and nurture
                 of thee, our heavenly Father; by giving them all good
                 examples in our religious and honest carriage and
                 behaviour; by chastising them for their offences.
                And to honour our superiors in heart, word and deed
                 and gesture; to yield all obedience unto them, to
                 imitate their virtues, to express our thankfulness
                 to them in word and deed, and to wink at their 
                 imperfections and infirmities. Contrary to those 
                 duties, we have wanted of that natural affection 
                wherewith we ought to abound; we have neglected
                our duties by contempt, our scorn, too much indulgence
                 and rigour, by lightness and immodesty, and too much
                 boasting. 
                Neither can we excuse ourselves, O Lord,
                
                
                
                from hatred, anger, evil will, desire of revenge, waywardness, peevishness, inhumanity, wrathful looks
                 and such like misbehaviours against our neighbours:
                 whereas thou hast commanded us unfeigned love,
                 one towards another, benevolence, compassion,
                meekness, long-suffering, affability, and all kind of
                 courteous behaviour.
            
            
                
                
                     
                 We cannot but likewise acknowledge our lustful concupiscence  — in heart, word and deed — in repeating love songs, filthy talking, all manner of uncleanness, as
                well with ourselves as others. Whereas, on the other side,
                 thou hast enjoined us all chastity; modesty in our 
                actions, words, gesture, attire, behaviour and conversations; moderation at all time in meat, drink,
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.59&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 59</a>



            
                 
            
              sleep and all such like necessaries. And thou hast
            
              
              
                forbidden us all inward grudgings and longing after
                wealth by avarice or coveting other men's riches; all
                    
              fraud, deceit, tricks in bargaining and selling; all
                usury, idleness, niggardise and profusion of thy good creatures: yet have we incurred the breach of all these, thy heavenly
                 directions, by not dealing uprightly with our neighbour in
                 buying and selling; by not caring to save him from damage;
                 by not doing the works of our calling; by not using liberality
                 or frugality in all our actions.
            
                
                
                
                And we must lastly confess, O Lord, against ourselves
                that thou hast enjoined us all plain meaning and
                
            speaking, all taciturnity, grave speech, a moderate use
                 of the tongue, the bearing of a good opinion of our neighbours and judging all things done by him to the best.
            But contrarily, we have delighted ourselves too much
                 in lying, false testimony, prattling, scurrility, defaming and backbiting, sinister suspicion and wrongful
                 judging our neighbours. <span class="quote">And now, O Lord, by this
                 looking glass of thy divine law</span>, we see ourselves
                so strangely deformed — nay, so much defaced with boils
                and ulcers and wounds — how can we contain ourselves
                 from sorrow and repentance until we have washed away
                 these sins and obliquities of ours in the fountain and 
                 comfortable stream of his blood that died for us;
                 wherein being once dipped, <span class="quote">though we were before as deep
                 as scarlet, we shall become as white as snow</span>. 
            But alas, we are not able to cast ourselves into this
                 pool, such is our lameness and imbecility, without the
                 help of thy spirit to work in us such a sorrow and
                 contrition that may alter and change these flinty

            Help us, we also humbly beseech thee, dear Father, to
                 punish our worldly sins of covetousness, ambition,
                 pride, thirsting after the outward commodities and advantages of this world, by making restitution of what
                we have got contrarily to thy law by being 
                 compassionate and bountiful to our fellow members. 
                Then shall we, by thy goodness, not only be freed from
                the imputation and present guilt wherewith our forepast lives have now defiled us, but bestow our 
                 future course of lives in walking the ways of godliness;
                 going from grace to grace, from good work to good
                 work, until we attain to that measure of perfection which
                 thou hast appointed to us during the time of our 
                 earthly pilgrimage here.
            And lastly, most gracious and merciful Father,
                 we are humble suitors unto thy heavenly majesty that
                 we may be assisted with thy divine and gracious spirit
                 in the dutiful ordering ourselves before, during the
                 time and after the receiving of this blessed banquet:
                 that before, with all the forces and faculties of our frail 
                 minds, we may extol thy goodness and wisdom in
                sending thy only son to redeem us; that, at that
                 time, we may magnify his obedience to thee and love to us
                 for shedding out his precious blood for us that were thine
                 and his enemies; and after, being cleansed with that 
                 blessed lavacre, be careful to keep ourselves undefiled that so, now, we may by his grace be cleansed;
                hereafter, by his favour preserved and, at the last, by his
                 love be presented spotless and unblameable before thy

In the vacancy of a wise and prudent governor — after my father's death and my Lord of Strafford's imprisonment
                by the parliament in England — that nation was under
                the authority of justices: the Lord Parsons and Lord Borlase.
                 These two old gentlemen, having lived in Ireland many
                 peaceable years, could not be made sensible that the Irish
                had an ill design against the English and, therefore, did
                 not take notice of their frequent, numerous meeting
                 in a strange insulting manner but, when they were informed by some judicious men , neglected the searching into that business until (through their remissness) the 
                 faction had got deep root and headed their designs
                 to a full maturity, 
            which undoubtedly had overwhelmed the whole body of
                 the English there (as well in Dublin as the country) had
                 there not been a most miraculous discovery of the plot
                made in Dublin by which, as the means our gracious God
                 appointed, we were delivered from perishing in those
                flames intended for us.
        
            The Lord MacMahon and Maguire, two of the ring
                 leaders of this wickedness, was designed to seize upon
                 the castle of Dublin, which at that time was richly stored with
                 all ammunition, arms, ordnances and other artillery
                 (for the defence of the castle and kingdoms) by the Lord Lieutenant
                     Strafford, well knowing that the Irish must be riddenride with a curb.
                 But this place of the English strength was then carelessly
                 at that time deserted; none being set to guard the bridge and
                 gates but four weak, old men that could make no resistance.
                 That night being Saturday, before Maguire should
                 have taken possession of the castle (he being designed the governor
                 thereof by the rebels, and should have seized on it on the

            Sunday morning) MacMahon, willing to save
                a kinsman of his own name — that lived then as a servant
                with Sir John Clotworthy, an Englishman — writ his
                 cousin a letter to Dublin to meet him in great haste
                 about a business of great concernment.
            His cousin immediately took horse and rode into the country
                but, finding him gone to Dublin, followed and discovered
                 where he and Maguire was set drinking, in a blind
                 ale house, at which door they had set men to guard it.
                Now, this had been converted a protestant about a 
                year before and married to an Englishwoman, but they
                 knew not that he was turned. He observed a long time,
                 by their ways and impious expressions that they used towards the English , so much as he feared some bad
                design in hand and, therefore, was the more diligent
                 in following them to discovery.
            When they were met, they fell to drink much — they
                causing him take more that he might be drunk — but
                 he desired them to tell him what they sent to him
                 for. MacMahon clapped him on the back and told
                 him that there was the gallantest design which was plotted
                 and to take effect shortly against the English dogs
                 that could be: to cut their throats and tomorrow, by six
                o'clock in the morning, said he, 'my Lord Maguire
                will be master of Dublin Castle', and they would
                batter down the town over the heretic dogs'
                 ears and not spare one of them.
            After which speech his cousin, the protestant, started
                 and cried out, 'What shall I do for my wife?'

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.65&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 65</a>



            
                
            
            
                They said: hang her, for she was but an English dog.
                 He might get better of his own country. So, he considering himself to be in their hand, who would murder
                 him if he resisted, complied for the time until he found an
                 opportunity to get away, which they began to suspect
                 and gave warning to the guard to kill him if he went out;
                so, they drank on until the protestant was forced to require
                 leave to go into the next room, for they durst not trust
                 him further. And he, withdrawing thither, broke down
                the window and leaped out of an upper room and over a
                 wall before he could make an escape to acquaint the
                lord  justices. But this man had also the river to swim 
                at that time of night, which was midnight, before he came
                to the first justice which was Sir William Parsons.

            Being come to the gate, he was forced to threaten hard
                before he was admitted and then he told him, 'My lord,
                 I am sent to you by the providence of God to save your
                 life and all the English. I am bound in conscience to deliver
                 my own soul in their preservation from the Irish who
                 intends to destroy them all'. And told him all the foregoing
                 circumstances, telling him withal that he must not look on
                 him as an idle, drunken fellow but as one which had almost lost his own life to preserve his, and that if he did
                 not take care to prevent this mischief all the innocent
                 blood of the English would be required at his hand, 
            with many such like expressions. After which, there was search
                made for the two rebels but none was found until the same man,
                which discovered the plot, found them himself: hid in the top of
                 that house within a trap door. So, they were taken and secured,
                and we all — poor sheep destinated to destruction — was thus
                wonderfully preserved and delivered in Dublin.</span><a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.66&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 66</a><span class="event" id="ev28-start">
            Whereas the rebellion began that Sunday in the country
                 with sword, fire and murdering all before them, not
                sparing infant of days nor old age, all was made
                 havoc of and so continued until they had notice
                 that it was discovered in Dublin and was prevented by
                our forces which defended the city.</span><span class="event" id="ev29-start">
            Yet cannot it be imagined but we had our share
                 in Dublin. When we were forced upon the alarm to
                 leave our house and fly into the castle that night with all
                 my mother's family and what goods she could.
                From thence, we were forced into the city, continuing
                 for 14 days and nights in great fears, frights and hideous distractions and disturbances from the alarms and
                 outcries given in Dublin each night by the rebels.
                 And with these frights, fastings and pains (about sacking
                 the goods and wanting sleep, times of eating or refreshment) wrought so much upon my young body that
                I fell into a desperate flux, called the Irish disease,
                 being nigh unto death while I stayed in Dublin</span><span class="event" id="ev30-start">as

                 for my two brothers, Christopher and John, with Tom Danby
                and Kitt (my sister's two eldest sons) and myself,
                 in providing a ship to transport us all, together
                with her good plate and household stuff in Dublin which,
                she afterwards delivered to my uncle, William Wandesford,
                 after she came to Weschester. But it pleased God to
                 give us all a safe and quiet passage out of Ireland

            into England, landing at the Beer House near
                 Neston, where we tarried several weeks by reason of
                my distemper (brought out of Ireland when we fled
                from the rebels).
            
            This, I say, brought me exceeding weak, so that I had a 
                doctor from Chester for my cure. After which, with the great
                 care and love of my dear mother, God was pleased at
                 that time to restore my life and strengthen my great
                 weakness, enabling me to go to Chester in a coach.</span>

                 most miraculously in all our dangers and extremities, 
                 bringing us safe, all to our own native country.

            After our coming to Weschester from the Beer House near
                Neston, when we fled out of the Irish rebellion, it pleased
                God to move the gentry of the city to be exceeding courteous
                 and civil to my dear mother and myself, assisting her with
                 what necessaries she wanted in a strange place, and such
                pity and favour we found that she wanted nothing in that
                    place which our neighbours procured not for us. In which number
                 was Dr Mainwaring and his wife, Sir Thomas Smith and his lady

          were beleaguered in Chester by Sir William Brereton's
          forces for the parliament,  and there happened a strange
          accident which raised that siege, July 19th, 1643. 
                As I was informed, there was three grenades shot into the town but through providence hurt nobody.
          The first being shot into the sconce of our soldiers —
          within two men of the captain, Mainwaring — but having
                 an ox's hide ready, clapped it thereon, and it smothering away in shells did not spread but went
          out. The second alight short of the city, in a ditch, within
                 a pasture amongst a company of women milking
                 but was quenched without doing them harm at all.
                 Praised be the Lord our God. The last fell amongst
          their own horse, short of the town, slaying many
                 of them and by that means the siege was raised.
                 Thus was we freed from great evils to befall that 
                 town while we stayed there that succeeded after
          we came into Yorkshire,</span> which still the Lord's hand was

                mercy, was recovered (although he was very much disfigured , having been a very beautiful child and of a

                 extremity of pain and sickness, and miserably sore

                 poor boy and dressed his sores with all offices as diligently

                 for all they had done for him.

                belief in the mercies of God through his redeemer, Jesus Christ,
                alone for salvation of him, and commending his soul to God

                 could be expected from such a child. He freely and willingly gave up his soul into the hands of his redeemer

                From Weschester, my dear mother removed with her three younger
                children: Alice, Christopher and John Wandesford (she having
                sent her two grandsons home from Chester before the siege).
                With these, and several servants and tenants, though with much difficulty —
                by reason of the interchange of the king's armies and the parliament —
         
                 she was brought into the town of Warrington towards coming
                into Yorkshire; she, finding more favour by reason of the captain's
                 civility and by a pass from Colonel Shuttleworth than usual,

                seeing nothing but a weak company for her person and
                 having lost all in Ireland (only two trunks of wearing
                 linen), they gave her leave to pass and, about ten o'clock
                 at night, we came weary into the town of Warrington.
                 After a while, we were entertained with alarms as was
                    pretended from the king's party in Chester. This was
                    but to awaken their diligence the more but there was
                no cause: for that poor town had work enough to defend
                itself from its enemies. 
           
     
           
            From Warrington, we went to Wigan the next day,
                being a town zealous for their king and church. We
             found it sorely demolished, and all the windows broken,
             many sad complaints of the poor inhabitants (being
             at our first coming was scared lest we should have
             been of the parliament party). Their cries were the greater in
             respect they were enforced to see the burning of 500
             of their own Bibles publicly at the cross by the soldiers,
             which they plundered under pretence of being popery
             in their service books and reviling them with the names
                of papists' dogs. But this town had been preserved
             from such false doctrine or heresy and would have died
             for the true profession of the protestant religion. 
            The memory of Dr Fleetwood was so famous at that
             time with them (which was a most pious, godly minister
             living about thirty years since with them) and by his life and
             doctrine had set such good order amongst them that they
             still retained the true religion he taught. They, hearing
             that my mother was his niece, flocked abundantly to see her,
            

                <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.79&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 79</a>



                
                     
                
                using all the civilities and kindnesses imaginable to her
                 for his sake. And notwithstanding that their Bibles and books
                 were burned, never neglected the prayers at six o'clock in
                 the morning and four in the afternoon. 
            
    
            
            The next day, we passed from thence towards Yorkshire
                 with many prayers from this people. And when we came
                 to the borders of Lancashire, at a place called Downham,
                 we were not permitted to pass but, with harsh language and
                abuses by a parliament corporal and his gang, they would
                 not believe our pass but took us down, swearing and 
                 threatening we should be stripped. So, my dear mother
                 and all of us was forced to come into a pitiful house for
                 shelter and lie there all night, with heavy hearts, lest we 
                 should have been used barbarously as they continued in
                threatening against my father's widow and children. 
                But, lo, our gracious Lord God — who sees all wrongs and
                 indignities offered to his servants in his due time rights
                    them — did bring us safe out of all our fears and dangers,
                 <span class="evquote">blessed be his holy name forever</span>, and turned shame upon
                 those cruel men that did abuse us. That night two of themselves , with my mother's servant, went to Colonel Shuttleworth
                    (10 miles off) who, upon the sight of his own pass, did declare his grand displeasure for their rudenesses to my
                 mother and children, causing his nephew, Captain John Ashton , to punish those villains and convey her safe as far as
                 his quarters laid, wishing her a good journey. Thus did
                 the Lord of Hosts deliver us all and making our enemies our
                    friends. <span class="evquote">Oh, praised be the Lord God of our salvation</span>, delivering

      My mother was minded to go to Snape, where my 
          sister 
          Danby
       was, and being invited by her, she went 

            
             
             thither to live, until she could better dispose of herself
            and us in those troublesome times. For it being in the 
            heat of the wars, she could not live at Hipswell, her
             jointure, which was molested sometimes with the parliament's
            and then the king's forces amongst them. (To uncle Norton's).
        
       
         So that for a whole year, we lived with great comfort and
         safety with my sweet sister Danby at Snape, </span>

            where she
            
            
          was delivered of a gallant son even in the midst of troubles. God gave her comfort and my brother would have
          him called Charles because of his engagement for the
            king's service.</span>

            Now, while we lived at Snape, my brother, Christopher Wandesford, was exceedingly tormented with the
            fits of the spleen, having taken them upon the death of
        my father with grief in the church at his funeral.
        Seizing then upon him, they continued sore, notwithstanding all good means used, laboured and endeavours of
        my mother and us all, with all means, medicines and advices of physicians for him. I am witness, and many more,
        that not anything was wanting which might conduce to his

                
        
            recovery. At the last, she, sending him to Dr Bathurst
            at York, where, by God's blessing, he was perfectly cured
            of this distemper. This was indeed a great deliverance of
            him from this distemper wherein many that has seen him has

            begged of the Lord to take him out of those torment. And, at
                 length, through great mercy he was delivered.

                 things given by Mr Mahum, with my dear mother's care,
                 I escaped that desperate fit and by degrees was cured,
                 only it brought me very weak and faint.</span>
                
            Praised be the God of all mercies for this, his merciful
                 providence, in delivering my soul from the <span class="quote">gates of
                 death</span>, even adding this favour to the number of the
                 rest and giving me great and fresh occasions to lift
                 up my voice in gratitude to <span class="quote">the Lord of our salvation</span>.
                Oh, give thanks unto the Lord most high which is great, 
                 wonderful and holy: the Lord increase my faith in thy 
                 name and thankfulness to thy goodness for these daily
                 deliverances and new lives given to me. <span class="quote">Bless the Lord, O
                 my soul: with all thy powers of soul and body, all that is
                     within thee, bless his holy name</span> and magnify him for
                 ever which has delivered also me and all my mother's 
                 house out of the violency of our enemies which hates us
                 without a cause. Lord, bless us and all thy servants that
                 profess the truth of thy religion and suffers for a good cause,
                that they may be delivered at the last and thy church and king
                 may be preserved to praise and adore thy name, and that I
                 may be bettered by all these trials and troubles that thou see
                 fit to chastise me withal in my youth to bring me near
                 to thy majesty in faith and godliness all my days,
                     for my Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

                 After I was recruited in strength, my mother went to
                live at Hipswell, her jointure with my brother, George, myself and George Lightfoot and Daphne Cassell, and my dear George Wandesford, his man. 
                And there she was troubled
                with the Scots one while and the parliament forces another while

                tormented us getting all our provisions of meat and drink, let us want all necessaries, yet their domineering and insulting voluptuousness must be supplied. And my mother
                was charged — for 18 or 20 months together — with £25 a month
                 in monies to the soldiers, besides the quartering of a troop
                of Scots on free quarter which was treble the value of
                her estate.</span> And at that time, she borrowed monies to 
                maintain all her four children (my brothers, Christopher and John, were at Bedale School from November the 16th 1643 many years, 
                which she paid afterwards)
                
                 albeit we had a particular maintenance to have been
                 paid out of Kirklington and for the heir's part out of Hudswell. Yet, even in these times most sad and lamentable,
                 did the Lord most high preserve us from ruin utterly and
                 made us have <span class="quote">a place of safety under his wings of 
                 protection</span> all those evil times of fears and distractions.
                 Blessed and praised be the God of our salvation. Amen.

                About this year, my dear and only sister, the Lady 
                 Danby, drew near her time for delivery of her sixteenth child
                 (10 whereof had been baptised, the other six were stillborn when she was above half gone with them; she, having miscarried of them all upon frights by fire in her
                 chamber, falls and such like accidents happening). All her
                    children were sons — saving my two nieces, Katherine and 
                    Alice Danby — and most sweet, beautiful and comely were they
                 all.  The troubles and distractions of those sad times
                 did much afflict and grieve her, who was of a tender and
                 sweet disposition, wanting the company of her husband,
                 Sir Thomas, to manage his estate and other concerns.

                But he, being engaged in his king's service was not
                 permitted to leave it, nor come to Thorp but seldom
                 until she fell sick. These things, added to the horrid rudeness of the soldiers and Scots quartered then amongst
                    them  which — vexing and troubling her much with frights —
                 caused her to fall into travail sooner than she expected;
                nor could she get her old midwife, being then in Richmond which was then shut up (for the plague was exceeding great there  so that all the inhabitants that could get
                 out fled, saving those had the sickness in their houses).</span><span class="event" id="ev55a-start">
                At this time did my dear mother and whole family
                 receive grand preservation from the divine providence
                    in delivering us from <span class="evquote">the arrow that flieth by day</span>, when —
                 as hundreds died so near us and thousands fell at noon
                    day, nay all that town was almost depopulated — how
                    did our good and great Lord preserve all us at Hipswell
                     so that no infection seized upon anyone that belonged us,
                    (although the malice of the beggars was great to have
                    done harm by rags, notwithstanding all her charitable
                 relief daily with much meat and money). Blessed be the
                    great and ever merciful Father, who did not deliver
                us up to this heavy judgement of the Lord but did rebuke the destroying angel and at last stayed this plague
                 in Richmond.</span><span class="event" id="ev55b-start">
                But to return to my poor sister, whose extremity
                 called her friends to her assistance: she had been very ill,
                 long time before her delivery and much altered in the heat
                

                <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.87&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 87</a>



                
                     
                
                of her body, being feverish. After exceeding sore 
                    travail, she was delivered of a goodly son, about September 3, by one  Dame 
                 Sworre. This boy was named Francis after another of that name,
                    a sweet child, that died that summer of the smallpox.
                This child came double into the world, with such extremity
                 that she was exceedingly tormented with pains so that she was
                 deprived of the benefit of sleep for 14 days, except a few
                    frightful slumbers, neither could she eat anything
                 for her nourishment as usual.</span><span class="event" id="ev56-start">
                
                Yet, still did she spend her time in discourse of goodness,
                 excellently pious, godly and religious instructing her
                 children and servants, and preparing her soul for her dear
                    redeemer (as it was her saying, she should not be long from
                    him). That week, when I was left with her after my lady
                 Armitage and my aunt Norton was gone, though she could
                 not get rest, yet all her discourse was very good and profitable to the hearers who might learn piety, chastity,
                 holiness, patience, humility and all how to entertain the
                 pleasure of God with contentedness; making so excellent
                 a confession of faith and other Christian virtues and graces
                 that Mr Syddall exceedingly admired her parts and piety,
                 giving her  as high a character as could be.
                She did entreat Sir Thomas, her husband, to send for Mr
                    Farrer and to join with her in the receiving the Holy Sacrament,
                 but he would not give leave which was to my knowledge a
                 great grief and trouble to her thoughts. That night,
                 she poured out her soul in prayer with such comprehensive
                 and good expressions that could be for her own soul, for pardon
                 and remission of her sins, for grace and sanctification from the 
                    spirit, faith and assurance, et cetera. Then for her husband, children,
                 mother and all her other relations, and myself,

                <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.88&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 88</a>



                
                    
                
            for the restoration of the king, the church and the kingdom's
                peace, with such pathetical and jealous expressions that 
                 all did glorify God for things he had done for her.
                 After which, she did in a manner prophesy that God would
                 humble the kingdom by afflictions for their sin and
                 security, but after that, when we were humbled and
                 reformed, whosoever should live to see it (for she should
                 not) should enjoy happy days for church and state.
                Thus, she continued and with prayers for our enemies, et cetera,
                 for they stood in need of our prayers for the forgiveness
                 of all their evils.
            She called her children, exhorted them abundantly
                 to fear God, serve him and love one another; be obedient
                to their father with admonishing them and her family;
                she was kind and dearly affectionate to her husband to whom, 
                 under God, she left the care of her seven young children.
            Sometimes, she did express abundant joy in God and
                 would sweetly, with a melodious voice, sing aloud his praise
                 and glory in anthems and psalms proper for her condition, with many sweet verses praising him for all things
. Nor was she in the least concerned to part with her husband
                
                 or children nor anything in this world; having her hope
                 and desires fixed upon God, leaving her children freely
                 to the providence of her God, who had relieved her soul
                 out of all her distress, who had promised to be <span class="evquote">a father
                 to the fatherless</span>. All her words were full of sweetness
                 and affection, giving me many hearty thanks for all
                 my pains and care I took with her, and watching a whole
                 week together; if she lived, she would requite my love

            with an abundance of affectionate expressions to this purpose. </span><span class="event" id="ev56a-start">My grief and sorrow was so great for her that I had
                brought myself into a very weak condition, insomuch
                 as my mother came to Thorp (with Daphne Lightfoot, a
                 careful servant) to help with my sister and sent me
                 home, who was almost spent in that time.
            At which time, I took my last leave of my dearest and only
                 sister, never could get to see her for my own illness
                 afterwards.</span><span class="event" id="ev56b-start">But she, waiting her Lord's time to be
                 called, was fitting her soul and 
        [heart]
     for him. As the disease
                increased of the fever — notwithstanding what could be
                done for her in that condition — it did to her, as many others
                 in such extremity, deprive her (for want of sleep and
                 food which she could not take by reason of a sore throat)
                 of part of the use of understanding for a little while when
                 its fury lasted. But Daphne was always with her, who
                 she had a great love for and as she grew weaker, after
                 a month's time of her delivery, holding her head on her
                 breast, said to her in a faint weak voice: 'I am going
                 to God, my God, now'. Then said Daphne, 'Nay, madam,
                 I hope God will please to spare your life to live amongst
                 your sweet children and bring them up'. 'How can that be', answered my sister, 'for I find my 
        [heart]
     and vitals all decayed
                 and gone. No: I desire to be dissolved and to <span class="evquote">be with Christ, which
                 is best of all</span>. I have made my peace with God'. And immediately she said, with as strong a voice as she could,
                'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit'. Then, giving a little
                 breathing sigh, delivered up her soul into the hands
                 of her saviour, sweetly falling asleep in the Lord.
            And thus ended that sweet saint her weary pilgrimage,
                 having her life interwoven with many cares and

            afflictions. Although she was married to a good
                estate, yet did she enjoy not much comfort, and I
                 know she received her change with much satisfaction,
                 being she hoped to be freed (as she said) from a wicked
                world and all the evils therein. Thus, departed that good
                 soul, having been young called to walk in the ways
                of God and had made his service her continual practice.
         </span>
                 The Lord sanctify this sad loss of this virtuous
                sister of ours to the whole family and that, as she lived the
                 ways of godliness from her youth, so she may be
                 a godly example to all her children.
               
                       
                She was a most obedient child to her parents; loving
                and loyal, affectionate and observant to her husband;
                 a tender and prudent mother to her children (bringing
                 them up in the severities of Christian duties, yet enough
                 indulgent over them with a Christian moderation).
                 A wise and discreet mistress towards her servants,
                who loved and honoured her in their obedience,
             truly affectionate to all her relations in general and
                 courteously affable to all neighbours and friends.
                 And, indeed, a great loss to all amongst whom she
                lived: doing much good and employing her time in
                 helping the diseased and doing many cures, following
                 the example of my mother in all those things.

            My uncle, Sir Edward Osborne, who was my mother's
                half-brother, was a very good, wise and prudent man
                 under whose tuition my father left the hope of his house,
                my brother, George, as — being joint guardian with my mother — 
                he had so fraternal a love for and parental care over my
                 dear mother and us all that we were most happy in
                him. And during his life, this — our family — was kept in much
                peace and tranquility (he, seeing that each party had its
                right and dues, with a care for the due observance of my
                 father's will of which he was an executor).
            But after his death, we (that is to say, my mother and her
                 children) was much oppressed and injured through the bad
                 managery of all that estate. And that was all seized on by my
                     uncle Wandesford for the debts, which he was much wronged of too
                 by one he made a lease of it for seven years taking many
                hundred pounds more than his due (and before he got it again,
                he put him to a suit). But in this time, all the children was
                 maintained by my dear mother from her jointure.
            My dear uncle Osborne, being at Kiveton with his lady

                fruit was too cold for him and struck him into a vomiting and

            strength was past recovery. So that, in a few days time,
                 he was deprived of his life to the great and exceeding loss
                to all his own family and ours, as also of his majesty's
      and country. He being a most excellent good Christian, true
                 and orthodox to the Church of England, a faithful, loyal
                 subject to the king and of a sweet and affable disposition to
                 all: in whose death I suffered the loss of a father and my
                mother, a husband. But he was very happy in a holy,
                 good life, a high esteem in his country, and of a great
                 fame for virtue and much lamented in his death,
             making a sweet and comfortable conclusion of his life
                 with an abundance of pious and religious expressions.
                 He died about the month of July, in the year 1646,
                at Kiveton in the farthest part of Yorkshire. </span>

                not their iniquities be theirs and our ruin.
            Give them a most sad and deep repentance and humiliation

                 rule peaceably and religiously over us with the establishment
                 of thy true religion in this land.
            And to this end, do thou most wonderfully turn the

                 in thy due time, freed from all these most sad plagues

            The fatal blow given to my father's family by the
                death of our excellent brother was very great, but the 
                 effects thereof fell out most heavy upon myself in
                the sad loss of so dear and loving brother; nay, I may
                say, a father to us all.
            He was a gentleman exceedingly qualified, with suitable
                 endowments both natural and acquired, giving himself over in the qualifications for the service of his God,
                 his church, his king and country, and such as rendered
                him much beloved and lamented, at home and abroad,
                for the great loss and sad conclusion of so brave a person.
                Yet enjoyed he, in his time after my father's death, not
                 much comfort; for since his return
                 out of France, in the
                 public calamities of church and state, he was driven to
                 many straits and hardships,

                 suggestion, and his estate — with all the other appointed for widow,
                children and creditors — of my father seized on for the parliament upon that account. This done under the pretence of
                 godliness and religion because he did not join in such
                 practices of rebellion against the church of God and
                our lawful king, whom God had commanded to be obeyed.

                 Nor could any adhere to such designs, whose hearts
                was sensible of those duties of faith and allegiance,
                 without the danger of eternal damnation and the curse

                 commands of God Almighty and the laws of the land wherein
                 were happily placed our peace and safety.

                 that there was no man of estate which did not lift up
                his hand against the Lord's anointed that could be freed
                either from plundering, sequestration and imprisonment,

                Mr Syddall: a very pious, godly minister but not of
                the presbyterian faction. This living, being of too good
                 a value for a royalist, was looked upon by one Mr
                     Nesbit of the other opinion, and so the more confiding person,

            After which it was conceived, upon such a crime as
                 loyalty to his God and prince, this privilege of the disposing of this, with the enjoyment of his own estate, was
                sufficiently forfeited. (Upon the point, thus much was
                confessed by Mr Nesbit to my uncle William Wandesford, after my brother's death, being the cause why
                he was sequestered.)</span>
            
            In this condition was my dear brother, amongst many

                might soon make a fault where there was none, and <span class="quote"> poor
                 Naboth must suffer that an occasion might be found to
                    take his possession</span>.  Albeit he saw too evidently that the king's
                 forces and power declined, yet could not his loyal heart
                 be gained to join with the actors in this rebellion, although there wanted not solicitations. But his heart
                 could not without abhorrence look on such practices
                 — more abominable than that of Ireland — because masked
                 with a fair show of true religion and piety to fight against the most Christian king that ever this nation had,
                 under whose government we might have still continued
                 happy, if our own sins, ripe for judgement, had not prevented God's mercies and stirred up the Philistines with the
                 discontented schismatics, instruments for our punishment
                in their rebellion.  It must
                 not be denied that my dear
                     brother's affections and conscience carried him in judgement
                to serve his king, the church and state by way of arms.
                Yet, as things then fell out, such was his prudence for the
                 preservation of his family, according to his gracious

            majesty's command to his friends, that he saw all
                 was lost and that they should sit in quiet and preserve themselves for the good of himself or son afterwards. So that
                 he saw it was in vain to strive against that impetuous stream
      to involve himself in utter ruin, wilfully, when no good
                could possibly be done by his service to the king otherwise
                 than by our prayers and tears for him: this was the reason made
                 him decline the engaging into that war.
             But his enemies' vigilance of all opportunities to gain
                 his estate, and this living aforesaid, had spies upon his actions wherein they might take an advantage against him and
                 had their designs furthered upon this accident.

                At his return into England, and in his passage betwixt 
                my uncle Osborne's house (Kiveton) to his own estate and
                my mother to Kirklington, he — being ignorant of the
                army's engagement that day on Hessom Moor — was to pass
                 that way towards York home.  But most unhappily it
                 fell out contrary to his expectation, and before he could
                 retreat anyway found a necessity to secure himself
                from the straggling company. And so, by providence, light into
                 the company of my cousin Edmund Norton's troop that day
                 until he got towards York for the securing my second brother
                there at school;  after which escape, he came to Kirklington.

                 would not take oath they saw him fight; being more
                 just not to perjure themselves than their masters, they
                would give in evidence only that they saw him on the
                    moor. So, when the kites could not prevail with them
                 for a more full oath to their purpose, they were dismissed without any reward save much anger and reproaches for their charges in that journey.
            This dealing much incensed the poor men, who said
                 afterwards they were trepanned into that business and
                 would not for the world have gone up if they could have
                foreseen the design to have prejudiced my brother.

                Nevertheless, this formality of the projectors was sufficient ground to proceed against him as a delinquent
                 against the parliament (though according to their own
                rules he was not liable, being underage);  yet where such
                 self-interest as by Nesbit's solicitation, it was legal
                 and all the right in the world that his good service should be
                gratified. And thus it was performed; immediately,
                 there was his estate all seized upon, he proclaimed a
                traitor to the parliament with my mother, my two younger
                    brothers, myself (all of us three being young, for I was but
                 15 years old and the eldest of  them). This was done in the
                 church of Kirklington by Mr Nesbit in a triumphing
                manner, and thereupon my brother's person should have
                 been seized upon, but he was secure through a disguise.</span>

                might tend to the good of the whole family, and was inclined

                in his relations which probably might bring me to
                 several inconveniences. Nevertheless, for so general
                a benefit to my family and hopes of finding a sober,
                religious person, I waived all other opportunities
                of greater advantages in estate, et cetera, which was propounded by several persons of quality and of my own
                 persuasion with myself</span>. <span class="event" id="ev65b-start">And presently there was
                 a treaty of marriage entered into by Mr Thornton and
                 my dear mother, which was depending until a good time
                after my brother's death.</span>
            But it so pleased God, for our greater affliction, when
                 we hoped to have enjoyed the benefit of the clearing his
                estate from that tyranny of sequestration, that we received a very
                grand blow by the sad, unfortunate loss of my dearest
                 brother, which was the preludium to our many afflictions

               that noble extraction and gallantry, not leaving in it his second

                The occasion of his death and our misery was
                this.  Upon the dispatch of that business at London, by
                my cousin Darley of the discharge of his estate from sequestration,

                done than himself; having laid at Mr Harry Darcy's,

                that night came to Hipswell to consult my mother's 
                 advice about writing to London to Mr Richard Darley
                 about that business. After his obeisance and craving her
                blessing told her he was now going to Richmond to my
                     uncle William where he would write to Mr Darley, desiring to
                 know what she pleased to command him further in it.
            My mother said that her service and thanks must be returned
                him for all his kindness in that business, which she would have
                done herself by writing but that <span class="event" id="ev66-start">she was suddenly surprised,
                 at that instant of his coming up to the chamber, with much
                fears for me (who was so violently tormented with a
                
                 pain in the right side of my neck amongst the sinews and
                 which caused me to cry out in extremity, nor could she
                 imagine what was the cause, only she still anointed it with
                oil of roses).  My brother, seeing me in such pain,
                asked how it came. Of which I could give no other account,
                having been as well before as ever until I was combing my
                 head toward the right hand and bending my neck as he came
                 up the stairs, and ever since it had held me grievously.
                 This was the circumstances of the strange pain, which held me
                 strongly until about half an hour, which was the very time
                 of his drowning.
            
                But to proceed to the circumstances of himself, he pitied me
                much and would have stayed with me but that his uncle William
                stayed for him at Richmond for letters that post. And after his
                 walking three or four turns about the chamber in his studying
                of his business, still methought I saw a great deal of 
                 change. He looked so seriously and soberly as if there was
                 some great change near, but what I knew not: only feared
                the worst that we should be deprived of him whom I so dearly loved.

                He, in a very reverent manner, knelt down and
                asked blessing at his going out again not long before,
                 which my mother took notice of praying God Almighty to bless
                him and said, 'Son, I gave you my blessing but even now, how
                 cometh it that you take so solemn a leave of me?'
            
                He answered, 'Forsooth, I cannot have your prayers and blessing for me too often'. And so, with her prayers for him in his
                preservation and his most humble obeisance, in a dutiful
                manner he took his leave, bidding me, 'Farewell, dear
                sister. I hope to find you better at my return home'.
                I, likewise, prayed him to have a care of himself and,
                looking after him, I thought he had the sweetest aspect
                 and countenance as I ever saw in him. And my 
        [heart]
     was 
                 even full of fears that we should lose him: there was so
                 great and entire an affection for him on whom we did all
                much depend. And speaking of this to him, he said I was
                always full of fears for him but he did not deserve it.
                And this was the last parting we had in this world, with abundance of dear love and affection betwixt us as we ever
                 had in our lives together.</span>
            
            
    <span class="event" id="ev66a-start">
            
            Going after this downstairs, he called for his horse and
                although he had two men my mother kept for him, yet took
                he neither with him, but bid his footman, James Brodricke,
                 an Irish man and an excellent runner, to meet him at
                Richmond at eleven o'clock where he was to meet my uncle William.
                So, my brother went towards the river, and as he rid by
                our chapel, where there was a wedding that day, he asked the
                 people whether the Swale might be ridden. They said that 
                 there had been a flood, but it was fallen for some had crossed
                the water that morning. So, he, bidding the people joy in their
                marriage, went very slowly towards the river.
            
                And as we heard afterwards by two men which saw him on the

                other side, he went down as carefully and slowly as foot
                 could fall. Nor was the second flood come so high until he
                was in the midst of the river but,  when it comes from the
                    Dales, it falls with a mighty, mountainous force suddenly,</span>
                <span class="event" id="ev67-start">
                 as I can myself testify, who (through the mercies of God)
                was very nigh perishing in that water once or twice but was
                 delivered.
            For, as I was coming betwixt St Nicholas and our house at
                Hipswell, if I had been but two yards of the shore, I had been lost
                by its force but, by providence, I was not above half the
                 horse length 
                    
                
                from
                
                ground and yet the horse was taken to the
                middle girths (albeit, it had been all the time I passed through
                before the flood came down but a little above the fetlock).
                Thus, wondrously was I preserved from drowning. <span class="evquote">The
                    Lord's holy name be praised even forever</span> for my eminent
                deliverance from perishing in and by these floods of waters.</span>
            
    <span class="event" id="ev68-start">
            But to return to the sad relation of my brother, which we was
                informed of by two men which walked beyond the river.
                 They perceiving a gentleman going down to the water, 
                imagining it some from Hipswell, seeing afar off that the
                 flood came suddenly and mightily down, made haste to
                the Swale, and see only his horse getting out of the river where
                 he had been tumbled in, all over head, and by swimming had
                 got out and shaked himself.  They got hold of his bridle
                but missed the person that rode on him: perceived it to be his
                horse, made a great search for my brother but could not find the
                 body. With great sorrow and lamentation, they ran to Easby
                 and Richmond raising all the towns, flocking in exceedingly with
                lamentable mournings and outcries for him whom they doubted
                was lost in that unhappy river.
            The most lamentable news came to Hipswell, where our very
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.106&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 106</a>



            
                 
            
                hearts were almost broken with this grievous, dismal,
                heavy blow. And loss of our dearest brother and for the hearty
                griefs and sorrows I sustained, it well-nigh had brought
                me to have died with him</span> and, if God had seen it fit, that 
                my poor unworthy life might have gone so he might
                 have lived for the good of his family.
            
            And but that the hand of our gracious God was seen mightily in my mother's preservation, we had been deprived
                 of her life also. This great blow added to her former
                afflictions and to have brought her with sorrow to her grave,
                 being deprived in such a heavy manner of the hope of
                 her house. A man of so great accomplishments and greatness that I have heard many lament and say that few came
                 near to him for excellent abilities, temperament of
                 body and humours, faculties of mind, ingenious and of great
                 ingenuity. A most obedient and faithful son to his
                 parents which increased their comfort in him.
            A dear and affectionate brother; a faithful friend;
                 a loving landlord; to his very enemies, ever courteous
                 and affable, not disobliging any by his morosity or
                 perverseness.  His very enemies then could not but
                 lament his loss said he was the greatest loss that Yorkshire
                 had for a brave gentleman. And if thus much came from
                 the mouths of adversaries, no encomium his friends can
                 set upon him can speak his worth and merit at whose hands
                 he had deserved so much. And I am sure the country
                 generally had a great loss of one so pious, understanding and loyal to his king, so that, if it might have
                gained him the world, he would not have taken a false
                 oath or covenant to wrong the church or his sovereign.

            March the 31, 1651 was his black Monday. The strange
                 pain which seized on my neck portended this sad loss.
                </span>
                <span class="event" id="ev69a-start">
                 Great and infinite was the search by thousands of people
                 from that time until Wednesday following, his body not being found
                 until on that day and about the time when he was lost.
            And then one of those men which was a witness against
                 him was the first which discovered his body, it being fallen
                 into a pool near Catterick Bridge, above a mile from 
                the place he was drowned: John Plummer, the man's name.
            After they had drawn him up, care was taken of his
                 body, which was as sweet and comely in all parts as in his life,
                 except one bruise on the nose which was thought to be done
                 when he fell upon some great stone, there being abundance in that wath place.
                    
                Albeit he was an excellent swimmer
                yet was it not the Lord's pleasure that it did him any help to
                 be saved thereby.</span>  
                <span class="event" id="ev70-start">The corpse was laid at Thomson's
                 on Catterick Bridge that night because it was deemed the
                bringing him to Hipswell would too much have aggravated
                my mother's excessive sorrow and endangered her life also.
        
                 He was carried by coach to Kirklington in the company
                 of all the gentry in that part of Yorkshire with a greater 
                 lamentation and sorrow than was for any within the memory
                of man at his funerals.
            He was buried in Kirklington church near Sir Christopher
                Wandesford's tomb, my great-grandfather. Mr Syddall
                 preaching his funeral sermon as I take it, and with as much
                 solemnity as those times and such a sudden accident could
                 admit.</span> And this is the true relation of his death, of the fall
                of this stately cedar of our wood, our staff to my dear father's
                 family, whose death cannot be spoken of without tears.
                 I have taken on me to enlarge more fully as to the circumstances
                 of the latter part of his life and death, as also of my honoured

            father's, with the enlargement of several circumstances
                 and passages belonging to both, because this age of the
                 world and sad times is so apt to raise and report false
                 things of persons of quality and worth, bespattering these
                 dead ashes according to the malice of Satan whom
                 they durst not presume to touch when living.
            And although I am not worthy to undertake this
                task according to each merits, I could not in my 
                 conscience be satisfied without the commemoration of
                 some of those resplendent virtues in them which I was
                a daily witness of, being obliged in point of gratitude,
                 according to my capacity, to relate the truth of these sad
                afflictions wherein I had a deep share and to leave
                 them for the right information to my posterity of their
                 finishing this life according to my knowledge.
                 He was buried upon the first day of April 1651.
            Sir Christopher Wyvill, who had a great love for my dear
                 brother, made an excellent paper of verses upon him in
                bewailing his loss, which I will insert hereafter.

                 thy powerful attributes and judgements, what shall
                 I say or do unto thy glorious majesty who hast 
                 looked down upon us with a mighty breach, adding
                 great sorrows to our public calamities? Thou hast a
                 controversy with this whole nation and also with this poor
                family by taking away our brother by an unnatural
                 death, when he was in hopes to have lived in peace and 
                quiet. Yea, then hast thou, O Lord, deprived us of our head
                 and suffered men to break in upon our estate, and disturb
                 our

            quiet enjoyment of this good land thou gavest to us.
                And now, at last, smitten the chief branch of our family.
                Alas, Lord, our God, we have been rebellious before thee and
                adding sin to iniquities by our disputes and disturbances,
                 and now we have lost a main pillar which preserved the peace
                and quiet of us all; yea, in a sudden and sad manner.
            Oh, what have we done in displeasing this <span class="quote">great and dreadful God</span>, walked unworthy of the mercies of so gracious
                 a Father, whose dealings towards us has been in much 
                 mercy and clemency; having preserved him and us all from 
                 the violencies of our enemies and the churches in many great and
                 eminent deliverances. Yet hast thou now taken him
                 away, who was the joy of our hearts in these sad times, to
                 our great discomfort. But what are we, O Lord, sinful
                 <span class="quote">dust and ashes</span>, in disputing thy pleasure? <span class="quote">Thy will be
                 done</span> in us, and by us and on us in all things.
            O Lord, teach us humility and patience and grace to repent
                 of our iniquities, whatever it be which is displeasing or hath
                provoked thy anger and displeasure in his death. Let us
                 bewail it all our days, being humbled for our miscarriages and nonproficiencies in thy school of afflictions:
                 the murders, wars, bloodshed, that especially of the
                 horrible murder of our gracious king that wicked doers was
                 let in upon him and us for our <span class="quote">crying sins</span>.
            O Lord, pardon; O Lord, forgive and do for thy mercy sake
                 make us not a <span class="quote">by-word and scorn to our neighbours</span> in these
                signal punishments. Return to us again and let not
                 sin prevail to our destruction, nor thy corrections to desolation, but <span class="quote">correct us in thy judgement not in thy anger</span>, <span class="quote">lest
                    we should be consumed</span> and <span class="quote">brought to nothing</span>. Put an end,

                 a great share in what troubles that followed to us all, and
                 pity thy humble, repenting, returning servant who
                 is smitten with thy rod and desires to receive instruction.  Lord, comfort my dear mother in these her
                 sadnesses and sorrows by the loss of so dutiful a son,
                 and make us that remain to be stays to her in her age
                 and my father's friends to be comforts and succours in
                 this world. Unite our divisions in this family that none
                 may wrong thy widow and her children depending on thy
                 providence. Let us all rest on thy merciful favour
                 for provision, without invading each other's rights
                 unjustly.  Let it suffice, O Lord, that this blow is given
                 and stay thy sword of vengeance against this nation
                in general. Let this, thy punishments, have this effect: to
                 drive out our corruptions and purge away our sins, and
                 then heal our souls and receive us to thy favour.
                 Forgive all our malicious persecutors and turn their
                 hearts that is the cause of our destruction.
            As this affliction came by thy holy pleasure and permission, so teach me and us all patiently to submit to
                 thy dispensation. Blessing thy name that he fell not by

                But before his change, though it was sudden, didst show
                 him thy mercies in considering his ways and reconciling himself to his God, and giving him the opportunity of thy 
                Holy Sacrament, a pledge of our salvation with great desires to serve thee faithfully in his generation, with many
                 many other testimonies of thy love as that of his estate.
                 And great abilities and understanding in religion, several
                 good gifts and graces, fitting him to walk uprightly in thy

                 seemeth him best</span>. <span class="quote">I lay my mouth in the dust</span> and say: 'I am

                 yield thy majesty most humble thanks and praise that I
                 am still preserved in all these times of ruin, and from perishing in the very same river at two several times; and
                for my mother's deliverances and all of us from the hand of
                our enemies and the churches. Oh, make not a full end with us
                which hath been ungrateful for these mercies <span class="quote">nor be not angry
                     with us forever</span>, but bless my father's family and <span class="quote">give him

                <span class="quote">our souls to be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus</span>'.
            I beseech thee, O Lord, humble us for this affliction and breaking the head of our number that the rest may lay it to heart and
                become wiser thereby. Give us not over to fall into the hands
                 of unmerciful and cruel men that fights against thy church and
                 anointed, but deliver us and thy whole church in this kingdom from the rapine of sacrilegious persons as would destroy
                the <span class="quote">seamless coat of Christ</span>, <span class="quote">tearing it in pieces by factions</span>,

                 and murder. Let not their prosperity allure, their oppression
                enforce or draw any of us to join in their designs. No,

            lest we eat of such things as please them and
                 sin against so great and glorious a God in robbing him
                of that honour 
                 — his only due and to none other creatures — of those
                 services, ordinances, sacraments, tithes and offerings all
                 thy own peculiar right, or detaining our king's due
                 obedience to his power derived from thee and thy
                 church which thou has graciously established here. By
                all which, we rob thee of thy praises and glory thou should
                 have ascribed for thy goodness in these things by
                 us, and may thereby heap to ourselves <span class="quote">swift destruction</span>
                 by invading thy right, the king's and church's.
            But, on the contrary, as we have hitherto been preserved
                 from such iniquities by thy mercy, so through thy
                 continued grace, we may be delivered from either doing
                such and, if it be thy will, from suffering by and from such practices as much as thou shalt see fit in thy gracious providences. That so we may still live in this good land,
                 enjoying once again thy peace in the restoration
                 of our right lawful sovereign, with the restoration of thy
                 church and holy good bishops to feed and govern and direct
                 this flock aright in the ways of thy truth and salvation
                 of our souls. That errors, schisms and rebellion may be
                extinguished and extirpated; thy good laws, divine
                 and humane, reestablished, and we of these kingdoms
                 fixed upon those axes again of truth and peace,
                righteousness and obedience. That we, serving thee in these
                 nations in true filial fear, may again enjoy thy
                presence with us, being a people saved by the Lord's miraculous favour and mercy, giving thee the honour
                 and praise
                 of all thy dealings with us.

            Make us 
                 a reformed nation, from all their evil ways
                 putting away far from us
                 the evil of their doings, that
                 we might not be abhorred of thee but to be a righteous
                people, <span class="quote">zealous of good works</span>, that thy name may be 
                glorified in our conversion, the honour of the Lord Jesus Christ

                 come into thy faith — when they behold what the goodness of
                God is to us most vile people — and give thanks with us
                 to thy majesty forever. And now, O Lord, most just, there
                 is no reason that thou shouldest hear the prayers of sinners
                but, in his name only, I most humbly on the bended knees
                 of my soul, beg these humble requests and put up petition
                for his sake that <span class="quote">suffered for sin and sinned not</span>. O Lord, hear
                 and do for thy mercy's sake: <span class="quote">for we are in deep distress, our 
                 souls draw nigh to the grave</span> and if thou dost mark
                 what is amiss, <span class="quote">who can stand in thy presence</span>? But with
                thee, <span class="quote">there is mercy for all the ends of the earth</span>, <span class="quote">and thou hast
                 commanded us to call upon thee in the time of trouble.</span>
            And further, O Lord, my God, leave me not to myself
                 but comfort thy servant; blessing, directing and guiding
                 me in all my life, in all my ways: <span class="quote">I trust in thee</span>. And be
                a tower of defence to my dear mother and her children;
                 defending us in this troublous times from all evils and
                dangers for the Lord's sake. All these requests, and whatever
                 else thou shalt see fit for us or myself — with pardon for
                 the errors of these imperfect prayers and acceptance of the
                 same, and pardon for all my sins and provocations — I beg even for the

                 have admittance to the <span class="quote">throne of thy grace</span>, <span class="quote">he ever making

                infinite mercies we enjoy, both spiritual for the good of
                 our souls) and temporal for our bodies. All which we have
                long since forfeited and deserved to have been deprived 
                 thereof, and then we should be most miserably <span class="quote">wretched</span>.
                 Therefore, it is my duty to recollect those favours and mercies
                 I have enjoyed under the wing of my dear and virtuous
                 mother.  When I call to mind her sufferings and ours for
                 many years, what cause have I of deep consideration
                of the goodness of God towards us all, which has not deprived
                 us of our sole comfort and stay by taking away my dear
                     mother in whose life was our support, with whom we were all preserved from death and ruin in Ireland, at Kirklington, at
                 Chester and in all places ever since my father's death. In
                 all these sad times, in the opposition of friends, the fall of the
                church and state — when her jointure in England being but £300
                per annum at best, fell 
                under £50 a year and when the Scots devoured
                all her patrimony, eating up her own and children's provisions —
                 even then did our gracious Lord <span class="quote">remember mercy in the midst
                 of judgement</span>, and caused her house at

                Hipswell to be a Zoar, a sanctuary for us all. And out of
      that little estate — then, not being the tenth part of the whole —
                 she relieved my brother George, which had a particular 
                
                 estate of his own as heir (though under sequestration)
                with the sum of £500. And since my fathers death, she
                hath expended upon her three younger children's maintenance, out of her own at Hipswell, the sum of
                 £1500 in our education and maintenance, as she has
                 declared by her own relation before witnesses.
            None of us ever having received anything out of
                that part of my father's estate, of Kirklington, for
                 the same as was appointed by my father's last will
                and testament. Therefore, will I give glory to our God
                 on high which still has preserved this dear and tender
                 mother; thereby testifying his miraculous favours
                 to the <span class="quote">desolate widow</span> and children in all times of
                 desertion and troubles, and being mindful of his
                servant, my father, in the blessing poured down upon
                his family. The Lord, our God, make us ever grateful
                 and thankful to his gracious majesty forever. Amen.

            After many troubles and afflictions, under which it 
                 pleased God to exercise my mother and self in, since the death
                 of my father, she was desirous to see me comfortably 
                 settled in the estate of marriage in which she hoped to receive some satisfaction; finding age and weakness to seize
                 more each year, which added a spur to her desires for the
                 future well-being of her children according to everyone
                 of their capacities.
            
            
                As to myself, I was exceedingly satisfied in that happy
                and free condition wherein I enjoyed in that time, with delight abundantly
                in the service of my God and the obedience I owed to such an excellent parent, in whose enjoyment I accounted my days
                 spent with great content and comfort. The only fears which 
                 possessed me was lest I should be deprived of that great
                 blessing I had in her life; nor could I without much reluctancy draw my thoughts to the change of my single life,
                knowing too much of the cares of this world sufficiently
                 without the addition of such incident to the married estate.
            As to the fortune left by my father, it was fair and more
                than competent, so that I needed not fear by God's blessing
                 to have been troublesome to my friends, but to be rather in a 
                condition to assist them, if need had required,
             especially more, in regard that I was confident of what
                 my dear mother could do for me (living) and at her death.
                </span>
                So that to show my dear affection towards my brother, 
                 George, in the time of his straits — for his better help in
                his estate, being sore burdened with debts, annuities, et cetera — 
                 I was willing to transfer £500 of my English portion
                 to be received out of Ireland which would have eased that 
                of Kirklington.  But since his death, when my second
                 brother came heir, there was not that cause to continue
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.118&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 118</a>



            
                 
            
            the same: by reason that both the sequestration was taken
                off and the wardship money of his brother denied to be paid to Sir
                    Edward Osborne's executor, and that he was better by £200
                 a year in his estate, with many other considerable arguments arising towards my mother and myself
                (for there was such unhandsome dealings to us, not to
                say dishonest, since my brother's marriage as could neither
                 induce her or myself, to part with our estates without security).
            
            But I shall be silent in these things, which afforded us
                 too much troubles and sorrows, wishing rather to cover
                 all things of the nature of disputes betwixt such near
                 relations.
            
    <span class="event" id="ev72c-start">
                And withal my youngest brother, John, being fallen into
                 a grievous distemper through grief, upon harsh dealing
                after the marriage of my brother Christopher (who, by ill counsel
                 given him, detained his right of annuity of £100 per annum
                to his great prejudice). And John was likely thereby to leave
                 both that £100 in England with his whole fortune (then descending upon John, by his brother George his death) of £6000 out of the
                 Irish estate to my brother Christopher.</span>
            
            Weighing all these reasons together, and that I had no
                 maintenance from Kirklington as I ought to have
                had by my father's will but was willing to forego that to
                my uncle William Wandesford towards the payment of debts,
                 I had no reason from all these considerations to lose
                 the payment of the said £500 out of Kirklington.
            
                Yet, I do believe from hence proceeded much displeasure
                 that I would not consent to wrong myself of the whole,
                insomuch that after the business of sequestration was
                cleared, he desisted the acting anything in my behalf.

                Nevertheless, such was my dear mother's affection to the
                 family, for its preservation, that she harkened to the proposal made for Mr Thornton's marriage (albeit therein she disobliged some persons of very good worth and quality
                 which had solicited her earnestly in my behalf, and such
                 as were of large and considerable estates of her neighbours
             about her). And after the first and second view betwixt us,
                 she closed so far with him that she was willing he should 
                proceed in his suit, and that cordially, if I should see cause to accept.
            </span>
            
            
    <span class="event" id="ev73a-start">
            
                For my own particular, I was not hasty to change my 
                 free estate without much consideration, both as to my 
                 present and future: the first inclining me rather to continue
                so still, wherein none could be more satisfied.
            The second would contract much more trouble, twisted
                 inseparably with those comforts God gave in that estate.
                 Yet might I be hopeful to serve God in those duties incumbent on a wife, a mother, a mistress and governess
                in a family. And if it pleased God so to dispose of me
                in marriage, making me a more public instrument of
                 good to those several relations, I thought it rather duty
                 in me to accept my friends' desires for a joint benefit than
                 my own single retired content, so that Almighty God
                might receive the glory of my change and I more capacitated to serve him in this generation in what he thus called
                me unto.  
            Therefore, it highly concerned me to enter into this greatest change of my life with abundance of fear and caution:
                not lightly, nor unadvisedly, nor— as I may take my
                God to witness that knows the secret of hearts — <span class="evquote">I did it not
                    to fulfil the lusts of the flesh but in chastity and singleness

                And to that end, that I might have a blessing upon
                 me in all my undertakings, I poured out my petitions
                 before the God of my life to direct, strengthen, lead
                 and counsel me what to do in this concern which so
                 much tended to my future comfort or discomfort.
            
                <span class="evquote">And to order my ways aright</span>, so that if he saw in his
                wisdom that the married estate was the best for me,
               that he
                 would please to direct me in it and incline my heart
                towards it. But if otherwise it were best for me to be,
                that I might still continue in the same <span class="evquote">but still referring
                    my will to his</span>. And also, to order my change that he so
                would in mercy give me such a one to be my husband
                as might be an holy, good and pious Christian, understanding, wise and affectionate that we might live in his
                 fear and favour, praying him to give unto me suitable
                 graces and qualifications which should fit me for that
                calling. And this, for our saviour's sake, I humbly begged
                in Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
            
                After which petitions to my God, I was the more inclined to
                 accept of this proposition of my friends, finding also
                that the gentleman seemed to be a very godly, sober and
                 discreet person, free from all manner of vice and of a 
                 good conversation. This was the greatest encouragement
                 to me when I considered the general decay of true
                 religion, in profession and practice, especially in the gentry
                and with men of quality (too many being given to a sad
                 course of life through debauchery) made me more
                 cautious in choosing,  fearing to meet with such as
                 neither knew God nor cared for their souls to preserve themselves in a holy course of life and conversation.
                 Nor could I ever have enjoyed comfort in this world to
                have been matched with the greatest estates

            or fortunes had I wanted that first and principal qualification in a husband  which is to be regarded above all
                the satisfaction this world can afford.</span>
            
            
    <span class="event" id="ev73b-start">
            I cannot deny that his estate, which was then favourably given
                into my mother, was the least in value which had been offered,
                 yet did my mother hope to find a handsome competency
                 without much charge as was represented to her: only
                 the want of a house which he must build, his brother and sister
                being provided for by his mother, that would clear his
                 estate which was given in to be £600 per annum.
            
                This was very well, considering the addition of my
                    father's portion given me by his will and deeds (namely,
                 £1500 out of England at Kirklington and £1000 to be
                paid out of his Irish estate of Idough) which would be
                an addition to increase Mr Thornton's revenues. 
                Also, my dear mother was willing to give me what
                 assistance she could out of her love and affection.
            
            
                 This treaty of marriage with Mr Thornton was very 
                 earnestly pursued by himself and friends, and as discreetly  managed by my dear mother as she could.
                For she was, in a manner, left alone by all our relations,
                especially after my brother's death, in regard that self-interest too far prevailed for those to hinder my
                 disposal to any person by the 
                 which they would be deprived
                 of their sinister expectations of my fortune. 
            
                But, through God's blessing, this treaty was brought
                 to a period to the satisfaction of each party and with a
                 general consent, and the articles of marriage drawn
                up by Mr Thornton (for the right settlement of all things
                 concluded upon betwixt my dear mother in my behalf and himself) were both just and honest done by him.

            The articles of agreement were according to the
                precedent of his father's towards his mother, videlicet,
                 that all his estate should be passed by fine and recovery to enable him to entail the same upon his issue
                 by me, male or female. 
            That his lordship of East Newton, then valued
                at the yearly rent of £250, should be estated on
                me for a jointure and, after the decease of the longer
                 liver of us two, to descend upon his sons and their
                issue successively; for want of such heirs male, to his
                heirs females by me, et cetera, without impeachment of
                 any manner of waste. 
            That Leysthorpe, valued at the yearly rent of £160
                after the decease of his mother, married to Mr Gates
                 and then her jointure, was settled on Mr Thornton for
                his life; after his decease, upon his heirs male and
                 for default of such issue, to his daughters by me.  
            As for his land at Cottingham, Richmond, called
                Burn Park, the inheritance estated as the other of Leysthorpe.
                
                 After a long lease made for the provision of his
                 younger children's portions and maintenance paid out
                of it. The value was accounted £100  per annum.
            
            As for the security of my portion: he was to receive
                 the sum of £1500 out of Kirklington, which he might
                dispose of for himself and his own use, being secured to me.
                 And for the £1000 payable out of Ireland, he gave
                 bond to my mother to purchase land of inheritance
                 for me during my life, and for my children at my
                 decease.
            And withal, my mother was willing to give us our table
                 with all our family for three years: these were the terms
                betwixt them. </span>

                 fine with him in regard that his father-in-law would not
                join in the fine, and my mother's counsel did not approve
                 of it to be legal for security without it. But Mr Thornton
                 did faithfully engage to do the same legally and
                 pass the fine after his death. 
            But, in the interim,
                 I was left in an uncertainty for the
                 security of a jointure in case of his death before me, and
                 when my portion was disposed of by him could have
                 no benefit thereby; so that my mother could proceed no
                 further, lest any ill consequent might follow, but
                 wholly this business was left to my own choice what
                I would do in this case. She, being loath, as upon her
                own account to undergo such a concern in which
                 there was such a hazard. Wherein she was not to be blamed,

             <span class="event" id="ev74-start">
      but Mr Thornton was very much troubled upon this unjust denial of his father-in-law, by which he was likely
                 to have undone his desires, fell into much sadness and
                 discontent, which perhaps might hasten his sickness that
                he fell into, on his going from Hipswell. 
            His ague began in the way to his mother's when, finding
                 himself not able to go through, came back to Hipswell
                 falling exceeding ill into a fever. But, upon the advice
                 of Dr Wittie, he was let blood and had all means used for
                his recovery but was brought dangerously ill. At the last,
                 it pleased God that he recovered beyond all expectation.

                <span class="event" id="ev75-start">
                And, upon his recovery, I was willing to rely upon his
                promise to my mother and his infinite expressions to myself. I 
                 rested upon providence in the fulfilling of his desire insomuch that about the December following proceeded our marriage.
                
                 This is the true relation of this grand concern of my life, which
                 I have been the more tedious in because I would leave to
                 posterity the right understanding of that concern.

            Alice Wandesford, the daughter of Christopher
                Wandesford, Esquire, late Lord Deputy of Ireland, was
                married to William Thornton, Esquire of East Newton
                at my mother's house in Hipswell by Mr Syddall,
                December the 15th, 1651.
            Mr Syddall made a most pious and profitable exhortation to us, showing our duties and teaching us the fear of
                 the Lord in this our new estate of life, with many zealous
                prayers for us. My dear and honoured mother gave me
                in marriage in the presence of my own brother, John
                    Wandesford, my uncle Norton, my uncle Darley (Francis),
                my cousin Dodsworth of Watlass, George Lightfoot

                 who had guided me in all my youth and virgin estate
                 to live in his fear and service and directing me to choose
                a godly and religious husband with whom I might, through
                his blessing, spend the rest of my days. And to this purpose,
                 I poured out my humble petitions and requests with hearty
                thanks and praise for all my deliverances (both spiritual
                and temporal) ever since I was born to that present hour;
                beseeching him that as he in abundant mercy had heard
                 my unworthy requests in the beginning of this treaty, so
                 he would now multiply his free grace and loving kindness to me, his vile creature, giving both to my husband
                 and myself all those graces and spiritual comforts we
                stood in need of, in this our marriage, that we might be married

                when he should call them and, in this life, instruments of building up his church and the raising up of my husband's family.

            That very day on which I was married, having been in health
                
                
                 and strength for many years before, I fell suddenly so ill
                 and sick, after two o'clock in the afternoon that I thought,
                and all that saw me did believe, it would have been my last 
                night; being surprised with a violent pain in my head and
                stomach, causing a great vomiting and sickness at my 
        [heart]
    
                 which lasted eight hours before I had any intermission. But,

                with my mother, was exceeding tender over me which was a
                 great comfort to my spirits.  What the cause of this fit
                 was I could not conjecture, save that I might have brought
                it upon me by cold taken the night before, when I sat
                 up late in preparing for the next day and washing my feet
                 at that time of the year, which my mother did believe was the
                cause of that dangerous fit the next day.

                 I received a great mercy in my preservation from God
                 and shall ever acknowledge the same in humble gratitude
                for his infinite, loving kindness forever.
            I looked upon this first beginning of my new condition

            About seven weeks after I married, it pleased
                 God to give me the blessing of conception: the first
                quarter, I was exceeding sickly in breeding, until I
                 was with quick child. After which I was very strong
                and healthy, I bless God, only much hotter than formerly
                 as is usual in such cases from a natural cause,
                 insomuch that my nose bled much when I was about

            Mr Thornton had a desire that I should visit his friends
                in which I freely joined. His mother living about 50 miles
                from Hipswell, and all at Newton and Buttercrambe.
                 In my passage thither I sweat exceedingly and was
                 much inclining to be feverish, wanting not eight weeks
                 of my time. So that Dr Wittie said that I should go near to fall
                into a fever or some desperate sickness, if I did not
                cool my blood by taking some away. And if I had stayed
                 but two days longer, I had followed his advice.

            In his return home from Newton, his own estate, I was
                carried over Hambleton towards Sir William Ayscough's house
                 where I passed down on foot a very high hill, betwixt
                Hood Hill and Whitestone Cliff, which is above a mile steep down.
                And indeed, so bad that I could not scarce tread the narrow steps
                 which was exceeding bad for me in that condition, and sore to endure the way so strait, and none to lead me but my maid
                 which could scarce make shift to get down herself. All our
                 company being gone down before, each step did very much
                strain me, being so big with child, nor could I have got down
                 if I had not then been in my full strength and nimble on foot. 
            But I bless God, I got down safe at last, though much tired
                 and hot and weary, finding myself not well but troubled with 
                 pains after my walk. Mr Thornton would not have
                 brought me that way if he had known it so dangerous and I
                 was a stranger in that place, but he was advised by some to 
                 go that way before we came down the hill. </span><span class="event" id="ev80-start">
            This was the first occasion which brought me a great deal of
                misery and killed my sweet infant in my womb. For I continued in all pain by fits upon this journey and within a fortnight
                fell into a desperate fever at Hipswell. Upon which my old doctor,
                Mr Mahum, was called but could do little towards the cure
                because of being with child. I was willing to be ordered by him, but
                 said I found it absolutely necessary to be let blood if they
                would save my life. But I was freely willing to resign my
                will to God's, if he saw fit for me, to spare my life yet to live 
                with my husband but still with subservience to my heavenly Father.
            Nor was I wanting to supplicate my God for direction what to
                do, either for life or death. I had very often and frequent
                impulsions to desire the latter before the former, finding no true
                joy in this life. But I confess, also, that which moved me to use all
                 means for my recovery in regard of the great sorrow of my

            dear and aged mother, and my dear husband took
                for me, far exceeding my deserts, made me more willing
                 to save my life for them and that <span class="evquote">I might render praises
                 to my God in the land of the living</span>. 
             But truly, I found my 
        [heart]
     still did cleave so much
                 to my maker that I never found myself more desirous of
                 a change to be delivered from this wicked world and <span class="evquote">body
                of sin and death</span>, <span class="evquote">desiring to be dissolved and to be with Christ</span>. 
            Therefore, endured I all the rigour and extremity of my
                 sickness, with such a share of patience as my God gave me.
                As for my friends, they were so much concerned for me
                that upon the importunity of my husband, although I
                 was brought indeed very weak and desperately ill about 
                 11th day of my sickness, I did let him send for Dr Wittie
                 if it were not too late. 
            The doctor came post the next day, when he found me very
                weak and durst not let me blood that night but gave me
                cordials, et cetera, until the next day, and if I got but one hours
                rest that night, he would do it the morning following. That night,
                 the two doctors had a dispute about the letting me blood: Mr Mahum
                was against it and Dr Wittie for it, but I soon decided
                 that dispute and told them if they would save my life
                I must bleed. So, the next day, I had six or seven ounces taken which
                 was turned very bad by my sickness. But I found a
                change immediately in my sight, which was exceeding dim
                 before and then I see as well as ever clearly and my strength
                 began a little to return. These things I relate that I may
                set forth the mercy of my ever-gracious God, who had blessed
                 the means in such manner: who can sufficiently extol
                his majesty for his boundless mercies to me his weak creature?
                
                
                For from that time, I was better and he had hopes of my life.
            The doctor stayed with me seven days, during my sickness, my

            poor infant within me was greatly forced with violent

                 that we could get a minister to baptise it though we 
                 presently sent for one.</span>

                 of him that gave it</span>. She was buried that night being Friday the
                 27th of August 1652 at Easby Church.</span>
            
    <span class="event" id="ev83-start">
            The effects of this fever remained by several distempers
                successively. First, after the miscarriage, I fell into a most
                terrible shaking ague, lasting one quarter of a year by fits
                each day (twice in much violency) so that the sweats was great
                 with faintings, being thereby weakened until I could not stand or go.
            After the ague left me upon a medicine of London treacle,
                 I fell into the jaundice 
                 which used me very hardly one full
                quarter and a half more (I, finding Dr Wittie's judgement true that 
                it would prove a chronical distemper). But, blessed be the
                Lord, upon great and many means used and all remedies, I
                was at length cured of all distempers and weaknesses which,
                from its beginning, had lasted three quarters of a year full out. </span>
            
            Thus, I had a sad entertainment and beginning of my change
                of life: the comforts thereof being turned into much discomforts and weaknesses, but still I was upheld by an almighty power. <span class="quote">Therefore, will I praise the Lord my God. Amen</span>.

                strength, and setting me on my feet after six months sickness
                 in my bed.  <span class="quote">I called upon my God, in mine anguish

                and <span class="quote">made my supplications unto my judge</span>. O Lord, I
                 have offended many ways, but thou art he that canst

                 thou hast put fresh opportunities of praising thee and

                 and soul in true and unfeigned thankfulness to thy

                 weaknesses which my soul had never seen before, until now.
                Lord, let me be kept by thy grace from any displeasing

                 to be a gracious God to me</span> and to all such as rely upon thee
                 by faith.  I know also that it is through thy dispensation that I am brought into the married estate of life and
                that thou,  in wisdom,  hast ordered each change and accident
                about this my sickness as to my danger and care. I beseech thee, therefore,
                O Lord, my God, <span class="quote">leave me not</span>: <span class="quote">for I am thine</span> and freely willing
                 to be at thy disposition, desiring thee to give me suitable

                It pleased my most gracious God to have compassion
                 on me and to give me strength to conceive again
                
                 about a quarter of a year after my recovery of that 
                most desperate and dangerous sickness (wherein I was
                 brought so weak that my speech was taken from me, not
                 being able to call for any help, but even as though
                 I were expiring for many hours together, and afterwards not able for many weeks to turn my weary 
                bones in bed nor help myself in the least). But, lo, behold , the goodness of God pleased to raise me up, giving
                me <span class="evquote">a new life</span> and new conception, hopes of renewing 
                 comfort for that sweet infant he took from me before.
            
            
    
            
                And albeit I bred my child in much illness and sickness
                 appropriate to persons in such cases, yet the hopes we had
                 of comfort in this infant by its life did much encourage Mr Thornton and myself to trust in the Lord, who
                 had brought me out of all my former extremities and
                afflictions to hope — in him in whom <span class="evquote">all things are possible</span> — for strength also to bear this child.
            
                Being about  11 or 12 weeks gone, I perceived the child
                to be quick, rejoicing in the Lord's mercy to me. My child
                was very lively about three weeks, and about that time, I found
                myself very feverish and hot, causing much sickness.
                 At which time there was no motion in it, which made us fear
                some further evil befall it or myself. Upon advice,
                 Mr Mahum let me blood about four or five ounces.
            When, lo, immediately thereupon, I found so great a 
                refreshment and cooling that the child sprang in my womb,
                 and from thence forward I had much health and strength
                all the time of my being with child, until within a month of my
                    delivery. When, growing big, I was in a wearyish condition</span>
        <span class="event" id="ev85-start">until my travail came on me about the 1st of January.

                At night, I was in much pain, wakening so out
                 of my first sleep so, and continued very ill in
                strong labour until Tuesday the 3rd of January, between
                 the hours of five and six o'clock in the afternoon.
            At which time, I was, with great and excessive torment and
                peril of my life, delivered through the infinite and
                 boundless mercy and goodness of God to me,
                 who gave me a sweet and beautiful, comely daughter
                 which was well-nigh choked with phlegm and the
                navel string (which was twice about her neck and arms,
                 so that when she was born she was without any breathing or appearance of life) with the sore labour I had:
                she staying one full hour in birth at neck and shoulders. Oh, blessed be the ever-living Lord God of mercy
                for evermore. Amen.
            Alice Thornton, my second child, was born at
                Hipswell, near Richmond in Yorkshire, the 3rd day
                    of January 1654.</span>

                 almighty power did alone work these great miracles and

                anguish when I lifted up my cryings with my voice

            I most humbly beseech thee, O merciful Father, since
                there is none besides thee who killest and makest alive, let
                  our lives be given to me and this infant <span class="quote">for a prey</span> to be

                 of glory to thy name and much comfort to her parents.
            Make her to be filled with wisdom, chastity, holiness
                 and piety to the Lord all her days, who hast had compassion
                on her, in this her tender age and birth, sparing her life. 
                And Lord, let me never be unthankful for these thy
                infinite compassions and mercies, with all thy former favours
                at all times, in all dangers and distresses.

               and grew blackish in her face which did sore affright her maid,
               Jane Flower, who immediately took her up and, with Jane
                   Rimer, the midwife, made help to recover her life. But all
                 that night she was so exceeding weak that my aunt Norton
               sat with her, and many others, expecting when she would have
                 died.</span>

           During this poor child's illness, I was almost at death's
               door myself by a great illness coming after I was in bed;
               so that my aunt and friends did imagine I could not live,
                 nor durst they tell me how weak my sweet Nally was at
                 that time lest grief should have dispatched me hence.
                 But they removed her in the cradle into the parlour.</span>

         This ill fit hindered my milk much but, yet afterwards, I recruited fast and within a fortnight had gotten
         the milk again into my breasts, and my dear babe, Betty,
                 did suck every day of me and I was overjoyed in that 
                 great blessing.  But it is usually so with me that I have
         my comforts mixed with sadness and many times my enjoyments are woven with crosses and sorrows.
           
           
    
           For at the fortnight's end, I was sitting in a chair and giving
               my child suck, when immediately one of the maids
               cried out of the nursery that my child, Nally, was either
               dead or dying, which so affrighted me, being but weak,
                 that an illness came in force on me as I sat. And there was much
                 to do to get me safe into my bed and there kept, betwixt
               hopes and fears for myself and child, two days or more.
               But, at the length, through exceeding much mercy and
               love of my God, he brought us both from those weakness
                 and I recovered strength in time. </span> <span class="event" id="ev92a-start">And Nally had an
                 eye tooth which broke flesh that had been the cause of all that
               danger to her (and often afterwards, when her teeth
               was cutting the gums, she was ill again until she had
               got them all).</span>
           
           
    <span class="event" id="ev93-start">
            But this second weakness of my own did so discourage my dear mother that she would not let me
                 give suck, although I extremely desired it, and at
                     the month's end, I was forced to dry my breasts which grew
                full and had endangered to bring me ill again.</span>
           
           
    <span class="event" id="ev94-start">
           And Daphne Lightfoot gave my Betty suck until she
                proved with child which, afterwards, was the cause I put her
                 to another at about three-quarters of a year old; but she did not deal
                well with my child, which was a most stately, lovely girl
                 when she took her to nurse.</span> <span class="event" id="ev95-start">Nor was I able to go so
                often then to see her, because it was a mile off Hipswell
                 and I was then with child, so that I durst not adventure a

                 repentance and cries in agony of spirit for a safe and
                speedy deliverance. And lastly, O Lord most gracious,
                 I humbly submit myself to thy most blessed will

                 which fall cast me into an ill fit of a fever and the jaundice

                 exceeding sharp travail, in great extremity, so that the
                     midwife did believe I should be delivered soon.
                 But, lo, it fell out contrary; for the child stayed in the
                 birth and came cross with his feet first, and in this condition continued until Thursday morning between two and three
                o'clock. At which time, I was upon the rack in bearing my
                 child with such exquisite torment as if each limb were
                 divided from other for the space of two hours, when, at
                 length, being speechless and breathless, I was by the infinite
                 providence of God in great mercy delivered. But I, having
                 had such sore travail in danger of my life so long, and the                child coming into the world with his feet first, caused the
                 child to be almost strangled in the birth. Only living about
                 half an hour, so died before we could get a minister to
                 baptise him although he was sent for.
            I was delivered of my first son and fifth child on the 10th

                 and the hazard of my own.</span><span class="event" id="ev109-start">
            The weakness of my body was exceeding great of long
                 continuance that it put me into the beginning of a consumption , none expecting for many days together that I should
                 recover, and when I did recruit a little, then a new trouble
                 seized on me by the loss of blood in the bleeding of the haemorrhoids
                
                 every day for half a year together.

                 failings of my duties is required both as to God and man.

                 destruction and did show me mercy in the <span class="quote">land of the living</span>.
                 The Lord, most high, make me truly remember his goodness

            It was the good pleasure of God to continue me most
                 wonderfully, though in much weakness, after that excessive
                loss of blood and spirits in childbed — with the continuance
                 of lameness above 20 weeks after, and the loss of blood
                 and strength by the bleeding of the haemorrhoids which followed
                every day by siege — and was caused by my last travail
                 and torment in childbirth, which brought me so low and weak
                 that I fainted almost every day upon such occasions. 
          
            And it was the opinion of Dr Wittie that I was deeply gone in
                a consumption and, if that continued longer, I should be
                 barren. All which being considered by my dear husband
                and mother, they were resolved from the doctors' opinion that I 
                 should go to Scarborough Spa   
                 for the cure of the said 
                distemper,  and accordingly, I went with Mr Thornton, staying
                 about a month there. In which time I did by the blessing of 
                 God recover my strength. after the stay of the former

                returning to Oswaldkirk by my sister Denton homewards. 
            After this great cure which the Spa wrought on me, for which
                 I most humbly return my hearty and faithful acknowledgment
                 of his mercy, <span class="event" id="ev112-start">we returned home to Hipswell, where we found

                 it pleased God to give me much strength and health,

            About this time, we were all in a great confusion in
                 this kingdom, none knowing how the government of this
                 land would fall: some desiring the continuance of Oliver
                 
                 Cromwell's race to stand; others desired the return of the
                 Long Parliament's power, which had acted the death of the
                 blessed king and to establish their arbitrary power
                 again; others intended — through the weakness of Richard,
                     son to Oliver, and then ruled as protector — to advance
                the interest of Lambert in public authority, which was a
                 man highly for independence and so would have utterly
                 destroyed both church and state in lopping off all who had
                 affection or dependency on either, rooting out the very
                 face of a clergy man, or gentleman or the civiler sort of
                 the commonality. In this distraction, each man looked
                 upon the other strangely, none knowing whom to trust
                 or how to be secured from the rage, rapine and destruction
                 from the soldiery in whose sole power was both the civil
                and ecclesiastic sword since the year 1648. And we had
                 all suffered so deeply under those oppressions that even
                the contrary party to the King did heartily wish an 
                 alteration from those pressures.

            Insomuch that most sober, wise people of this nation
                 began to have a good opinion of the ancient government of this realm, under which they had lived so
                many peacable years when they had smarted for
                 their fickleness in changing it, made them experience which was the best and most desirable for its happy productions of peace and truth.
            Thus, did it please the divine wisdom so to order it
                in great and miraculous mercy that, when we had felt the
                 evils of our sad divisions, and our growing higher towards utter destruction in their continuance in them,
       he thereby taught the nation wisdom, and did incline
                 their hearts to return to their old station under
                 the notion of a free parliament.
            As all the world stood amazed, at our unheard-of follies
                 and confusions, when the best frame of government was
                 pulled down and destroyed, so was there great combinations against us of all sides by our enemies 
                 to have rooted out our name and nation.
             And this, by all people of several persuasions and religions, would have been glad of so rich a prize.
            <span class="evquote">But he who is the keeper of Israel, that neither slumbers
                 nor sleepeth</span>, watched over us for good and was a <span class="evquote">tower

                at Isleham in Cambridgeshire — my grandfather

            and grandmother living then at my aunt's house at
                Isleham — being the eldest child of my grandfather's and intended by him to have inherited his estate (having so
                 entailed it upon her at his first going beyond sea
                in Calais voyage). After some years, he returned into
                 England and it pleased God to give them a gallant son
                 and heir, which afterwards proved a most excellent, wise and
                 good man, Sir Edward Osborne of Kiveton, Baronet:
                 a faithful, prudent man; zealous for God, the king and the
                 church, of great abilities to serve his king and country
                being advanced to be Lord President of York and
                 lived and died in much honour and fame.
            To return to my mother, who was bred up in her youth
                 and infancy with much care and circumspection by the eye of
                 my grandmother, a discreet and wise woman, giving her
                 all the advantages of breeding and good education that the
                 court and those times could afford, which was indeed excellent
                for gravity, modesty, and piety and other suitable qualities  for her degree (as writing, singing, dancing, harpsicals, lute
                and what was requisite to make her an accomplished lady,
                 as she did approve herself in all her time).</span><span class="event" id="ev116-start">
            At the age of 21 years, she was married by the consent
                of her mother (being then herself married to Sir
                 Peter Frescheville, having lived seven years a widow
                 since my grandfather's death). The portion which my father
                 received was very fair in those days, being £2000 paid the next day of their marriage.
                 Nor was she awanting to make a far greater improvement
                 of my father's estate through her wise and prudential 
                 government of his family, and by her care was a means
                 to give opportunity of increasing his patrimony, as
                 my dear father is pleased to leave upon record in his
                     own Book for her eternal honour,
                
                 so that it might be
                 said of her: <span class="evquote">many daughters have done well but thou
                     exceedest them all</span>.

            It pleased God to enrich my father and mother with the
                 chief end for which marriage was ordained, the blessing
                 of children.</span> My mother bringing forth to him seven
                 hopeful enough to live and to be comforts to their parents: four sons and three daughters.
            The eldest being Katherine; the second, Christopher,
                 who died at six years old, was a wise and beautiful
                 child, endowed with piety and parts, whose loss was very
                 deeply resented by his parents.
            The third was George, whom I have had occasion
                 to mention in this Book.
            The fourth was Joyce, a sweet and comely child, died
                 about four years old.
            The fifth myself, Alice Thornton.
            The sixth, my brother Christopher Wandesford,
                 now heir to my father after my brother George his
                 death.
            The seventh and last child was John, born at
                 London before she went for Ireland. A sweet, beautiful and pregnant child and young man: an excellent
                 scholar and of piety and parts beyond his years. 
            
            
    <span class="event" id="ev117-start">
            My father, being called over into Ireland to serve
                the king in the Rolls office in that kingdom (by reason of
                 my mother's late weakness after her delivery of
                 my brother John) went into Ireland one year before
                 my mother and her family.
            After which, she had a safe passage thither;</span> living in
                 much comfort and happiness all my father's life,
                 doing much good to all people in each sphere
                 wherein she acted; laying out herself to the best
                for her husband, whom she highly honoured; her child,
                 friends and servants found there, as in England, a
                 perpetual effluence of all graces and virtues flowing
                 from so full a spring which God had endowed her
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.161&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 161</a>



            
                 
            
            noble soul withal: lived in great peace, tranquillity and
                 charity, full of meekness, humility, chastity, modesty,
                 sobriety and gravity. Yea, was she endowed with great wisdom
                 in the constant course of her life: of a sweet and pleasant composure of spirit, not sullenly sad nor vainly light
                 but of an excellent temper in soul and body, neither of
                 them wanting those due ornaments which might make
                 her lovely in the eyes of God and man. And indeed, exactly studious to advance the interest of her duties in piety
                 and religion in herself and all her children, whose care
                 was very sedulous for their souls' happiness as well as
                 the embellishments of their persons; desiring to yield her
                 accounts to God in righteousness and truth, according to the
                 sincerity of her soul in his service.
            Thus, were we happy and blessed that we are children
                 and offspring of such a holy and sanctified a couple, whom
                 God Almighty had filled with such a measure of his spirit
                 making them great ornaments of religion.
          
            After my dear father's decease, she lived his widow
                 until her death, which was the space of 19 years and seven days,
                 dying in that same month of December and in old age.
                
                 But she was not one of those that lived in pleasure, or
                 spent her days in vanity; for what time could be spared from works of necessity and duty to her children and
                 family, all the rest was given to the service of her God, 
                 either as works of piety and devotion in private and public,
                 or charity towards her brethren whom she saw did stand
                 in need and necessity. Especially having a due regard and
                 compassion upon those clergy which, through the rigour
                 of those times of oppression, were banished from their own
                homes, wanting all manner of relief with their families
                 very often, and frequently found the bowels of <span class="quote">a good Samaritan</span> in hers. She, opening her arms to receive Christ
                 in his poor members, accounting it a great happiness

            that he vouchsafed her the honour to be instrumental
                 for the relief and support of such as were precious in 
                 his sight.
            I have formerly made a discourse of her travels and
                 several accidents that befell her person and family after
                 my father's death until she came to live at her jointure
                at Hipswell, and also what troubles and trials losses,
                 and crosses, she underwent almost all the time she lived
                 there (as well as from the unnatural actions and unkindness of friends, which had repining thoughts that she should
                 enjoy her jointure, as from the public enemies and
                 disturbances from the public calamities of church
                 and state).
            All which she endured with a noble and invincible spirit,
                 being fortified by her religion and the testimony of
                 a good conscience that she laid out herself for
                 God's service and glory, and the good of my father's whole
                 family and the general benefit of Christians amongst whom she lived; yea, even in those sad times of
                 losing all, many hundreds were relieved and supplied at
                 her door.
            For her exceeding kindnesses done for the help of the heir,
                 younger children and debtors of my father's, let her
                 own narration, delivered from her in writing before
                 witnesses, declare what and how she expended upon
                 that account. (She, being in a manner compelled to
                 leave such a testimony from some unworthy prejudice
                 which said she did not much from her estate for them.)
            But it was requisite for such an act of kindness,
                 which she did spending all she received upon us, that it should
                 not be forgotten by that family who received so grand
                 a blessing in her life and preservation, without the which it is too
                 probable that we might have been made merchandise of.

            Should I forget her unparalleled wisdom, goodness, 
                 tenderness, love and parental affection by which she governed all her gracious actions towards us in our maintenance and education, <span class="quote">I should be worse than an infidel 
                 who had forsaken the faith</span> and been ungrateful to that God which
                 made them, and <span class="quote">the very ox and ass which knows his owner's
                 crib</span> would rise up in judgement against me.
            Therefore, do I desire — in point of gratitude to God, my 
                Father, and that gracious mother whom he gave me — to mention those great mercies we received from her in general,
                 and in particular for those exceeding goodness and favours
                 wherein she extended her bounty towards me.
            Who was pleased to provide an habitation for me after
                 her decease and disposed me in marriage. After which, I, with
                 my husband and children, did live with her eight years after
                 my marriage, bringing forth four of my children in her house
                and had all manner of charges, expenses and household
                 affairs in sicknesses, births, christenings and burials of
                and concerning ourselves and children, with the diet, et cetera, of 
                 nurses, men servants and maids, and our friends entertainments: all things done of her own cost and charges all her
                 days while she lived which could not be of less value to
                 us clearly
                 than £1600.
            
            And no small addition of help to my husband's estate
                 was her disposal of her real estate in land, which she
                 had purchased for £550, settling it upon myself and my 
                 children.
            Also, her exceeding affection extended itself in her
                settling all her personal estate by deeds of gift and her
                last will and testament, saving her debts and legacies and
                 funerals in feoffees in trust for the use of myself, 
                 husband and children. All which I confess far exceeding my
                 merit but not her entire affection for my constant
                 being with her in her sorrows and solitudes.
            And albeit she had, in our minorities, disbursed upon us
                 out of her own jointure, which should have been done out of
                 Kirklington the sum of £2000.

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.164&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 164</a>



            
                
            
            The sum of £2000 besides, above £500 to my brother
              George, the heir, with the payment of £300 debt of that estate
              and the loss of all my father's personal estate given her
                by will, as also her loss of her annuity of £300 per annum
              out of Ireland, to the value due unto her at her death
            
            
                
             
        
                the sum of 300 per annum, which never received any part
                thereof. Yet, notwithstanding all the aforesaid goodness
                of hers to that estate, there wanted not some who put
                 
                 hard thoughts into the heir's mind that she dealt hard
                 by because she did not give all her widow's patrimony
                to him (when as all her former helps did redound 
                 to his benefit, and withal they knew our estate was more
                 burdened at that time which might require such 
                 helps from her because we were contented, for the
                 ease of Kirklington, to receive my portion from thence
                yearly and not in an entire sum).
            Besides this, she fitted my youngest brother, John Wandesford,
                 with the opportunity of good schools (as Bedale, Chester,
                 Richmond) with all other provisions of maintenance and
                books and all necessaries for Cambridge, leaving him
                under the tuition of Dr Widdrington in Christ's College,
                 maintaining him there all the time which, by reason of 
                 a sore fever that seized on him there, he cost her after
                 the rate of above £100 per annum.
            All which time his annuity lay dormant in the estate of my
                 father, which I suppose was some advantage to the heir.
                 In fine, great and many were the good and charitable acts
                 this most dear and excellent mother of ours did to us
                 all: she so wisely and justly disposing her estate
                 amongst us that none had the least cause to complain
                but bless God for her wise dispensation,
             being truly thankful for the safe protection care and
                 preservation we enjoyed under her wing.

            In all our sad times of calamity which our eyes beheld,
                 she, restraining and moderating her own expenses most
                 frugally and good housewifery that she neither lived in a penurious but a noble, handsome, manner: to whom both our
                 friends and her own was freely entertained and welcomed.
                Her poor tenants was more happy in her than many
                 of her bordering neighbours, who, although exceeding
                 poor at her first coming, yet by God's blessing upon
                 her discreet ordering her affairs in her estate that the
                 tenants grew rich after little time in those distractions,
                 and since have infinitely bewailed her loss whose person
                living they had so great an honour for.
            It was very observable that she outlived those sad
                troubles upon the kingdom in part, though not until the
                 restoration of our happy King Charles II, whose coming was daily prayed for and heartily wished. And
                 the last soldiers which quartered at Hipswell proved
                to be such as turned to General Monck from Lambert
                and, within a short time, the mighty power and providence of
                 God turned the minds and hearts of the people as a mighty
                 river towards its own channel. After her disease, which
                 she had put up so many prayers to God for and would have
                been a joyful day for her to have lived to seen,
             but I hope God had prepared a great reward in heaven
                 for her for all her toil and sorrows she endured in this 
                Bochim and <span class="quote">vale of tears</span>, and after three weeks sickness gave
                 her the full fruition of her long-desired happiness.

            It pleased God to visit my dear and honoured mother,
                 the Lady Wandesford, with her last sickness upon
                 Friday the 17th of November 1659, beginning then with an
                 exceeding great cough which tormented her body with
                 stitches in her breast, and troubled her with short

            breathing. These stitches continued about 14
                 days together hindering her from almost any sleep
                 or rest insomuch that it was wonderful how she
                 could subsist. But upon the use of bags with 
                 fried oats, butter and chamomile chopped laid to her
                sides, the stitches removed, and the cough abated as to
                 the extremity thereof.
            But then she was seized with a more dangerous symptom of a hard lump contracted in her stomach
                 that laid on her heart, with great pain and rising up
                 to her throat, almost stopping her breath when she
                 either swallowed anything or laid to sleep,
                 which lump was conceived to be contracted
                 of wind and phlegm in the stomach for lack of
                 voidance.
            She had also an exceeding sore throat and 
                 mouth, so that she was deprived of the benefit of eating or swallowing almost any kind of food, save
                 a little drop of beer being the most she took inwardly for four or five days and that but with a syringe.
                 Her tongue and mouth, at first, was black; then it
                 turned white, so that with the pains my dear mother
                 took in washing and cleansing, the skin came off
                 and was red until the blood came (this continuing until,
                 in the end, her mouth grew white all over).</span><span class="event" id="ev119a-start">
            In this most sad condition of weakness was
                 my dear mother, almost quite without food, rest
                 ease or sleep for about a week. In which time, as
                 also in all the rest of her sickness, she expressed
                 extraordinary patience: still saying, <span class="evquote">it was the
                     Lord that sent it to her and none else could take it from
                     her and,  if he pleased to see it fit, he could ease her
                 or give her patience to endure his hand</span>.

            Often would she say that the way to heaven was by the
                 <span class="evquote">gates of hell</span>, and that <span class="evquote">the lion of the tribe of Judah would
                 deliver her</span>. Likewise, would she frequently break
                out and say, with <span class="evquote">the sweet psalmist of Israel</span> in the midst of her inexpressible pains and torments, <span class="evquote">Why art
                 thou so full of heaviness, O my soul, and why art
                thou so disquieted  within me</span>? <span class="evquote">I will still hope in
                 my God</span> and <span class="evquote">put my trust in the God of my salvation</span>,
                 who <span class="evquote">is the help of my countenance and my God</span>'.
            She frequently repeated the 71st Psalm, which she said
                was penned for old age. Surely, she was a great example and pattern of piety, faith, patience; of fortitude
                 and resolution to <span class="evquote">withstand all the fiery darts of Satan</span>
                 which he, in her weakness, cast to affright and hinder
                 her journey to heaven. But he, in whom she put her 
                 whole confidence and served from her youth up, did
                 not now leave her in extremity but so assisted her
                 in soul and spirit that it was an heavenly sight to the
                 beholders even to her last period. And notwithstanding
                all her torments, still she put forth herself — for the
                glory of God and the good of her family and beholders —
                 in good instructions, severe reproofs for all sins in
                 general, with a continual praying to God and praising
                 him in psalms suitable for her condition, speaking
                 to God in his own phrase and word: saying that we could
                 not speak to him from ourselves in such an acceptable a manner as by that which was dictated by his own
                 most Holy Spirit. She often desired her friends to
                 pray with her, and for her, and told them that she desired that
                 they would not pray for her continuance in this life
                 for she was weary of it and desired to obtain a better
                 and to be fitted for it. And that these should be the heads
                on which they should petition God for her. Videlicet: 
            
            That the Lord would be pleased to grant her true

            and <span class="evquote">unfeigned repentance for her sins, which he had
                 mercifully pleased to begin in her already, and to perfect the same</span>.
            <span class="evquote">To give her pardon, remission and forgiveness for
                 them through Jesus Christ, her dear saviour</span>.
                 To grant her true faith in him to believe all his
                promises in the gospel and laying hold on him for
                salvation with the sanctification of his Holy Spirit,
                and at last to glorify her in heaven in his good
                time: which petitions, said she, 'whosoever shall make
                for me, the Lord hear and grant the same'.
            
            
    
            <span class="evquote">This sweet saint of God</span> had always a great and
                unfeigned love for all God's faithful ministers, and
                 often desired their prayers, giving great attention
                to them, having much comfort in her soul after that
                 ordinance.  Her desires was earnest to receive
                the Holy Sacrament which she did with great comfort
                 on Thursday (was sennight before her departure)
                 from Mr Peter Samways although it was with
                 great difficulty of swallowing (she never tasting
                dry bread after for that excessive weakness).
            Her desires was to Mr Kearton, he would preach her

            This blessed soul had the gift from her God to 
                 continue until her last breath her perfect memory, understanding and great wisdom and piety, ever
                 preparing her soul for God and recommending herself
                 in devout ejaculations, crying out with St Paul:
                 <span class="evquote">I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ</span>. And all that
                 Friday night before she departed, having this sweet
                 saying in her mouth, '<span class="evquote">Come Lord Jesus, come quickly</span>',
                 she making Daphne to pray with her that prayer of Dr

                Smith made in his book for a person at the point to die,
                 and took great notice of each petition praying with
                 zeal and ardency.
            It was very observable in all her sickness, as indeed she was not wanting of her gratitude to God 
                 for his exceeding testimonies of his love and mercy
                 to her in all her preservations and deliverances of
                 her and her children, which she very often repeated, 
                severally enumerated, in her best health; so was
                 it now, in her grand weakness and torment even until
                 her death, still the subject of her discourse; calling
                 to mind the wonderful and infinite goodness of God to
                 her even from her childhood; setting forth his 
                 favours to her soul and spiritual mercies innumerable which she particularly mentioned. And then 
                 she mentioned all her manifold preservations and
                 deliverances of her person from death and destruction,
                 making such an excellent catalogue of all that it was 
                 a great consolation to the hearers. And proved by these
                things — as a great argument of the support of her drooping spirits now at the hour of death, being a strong
                bar of defence against her spiritual adversaries —
             that God had appeared gloriously for her that was his
                 servant, who had delivered her from time to time
                 whenever she called on him: her Lord never forsaking
                her but brought her to <span class="evquote">the gates of death</span> in a happy old
                 age and to the sight of heaven where she fain would be.
                 And in him she alone trusted, through the merits of Christ,
                he would still deliver her from hell and sin and Satan and
                 preserve her to his kingdom; there to live with him forever, where she might spend the whole eternity of praise
                 and thanksgiving and hallelujahs of glory to the blessed Trinity.
                 Until which time, she was thirsting and longing and <span class="evquote">desirous to be
                 dissolved and to be with Christ Jesus</span>, her redeemer.

            For nothing of this world, nor in it, could hinder
                 her fixedness for heaven; nor indeed, did the concerns of this life come into her thoughts, saving to leave
                 her pious and Christian instructions and holy admonitions amongst us, her children and servants, and to learn
                 by her how to live well and die happily, joyfully and comfortably embracing and often calling for death to let her
                 into the enjoyment of her Lord.
            She had made several times in her sickness, upon occasion of ministers visiting her, many very excellent
                 confessions of her faith and profession of those Christian
                 foundations upon which our faith was built, and of her
                true zeal to the service of God in his holy ordinances
                of our most pious and Christian Church of England,
                wishing us and charging, as we would escape the danger
                 of damnation, not to dishonour that great God whom we
                 served by renouncing that faith and profession which
                 was taught us by the holy clergy and bishops of
                 England; never to listen to the insinuations of any 
                factious, new doctrines whatever but serve God 
                truly and sincerely therein, and he would accept of our
                souls and we should be happy; if not in this world, yet
                 hoped in a better; and that she did believe that — if we
                 humbled ourselves for the abominable sins of this nation
                and pray to God faithfully and serve him sincerely in 
        [heart]
     —
                 God would return in mercy and restore his decayed
                 church in England and his servant's son (blessed King
                 Charles I's posterity) to rule in this nation.
            Praying heartily, we might be delivered from popery,
                which these divisions and schisms might tend to if not
                 prevented by the all-wise providence of Almighty God.
                 As to her own particular: she blessed God for making
                 known to her the truth and preserving her therein, declaring
                 that she made it her constant endeavour to walk therein
                 all her days, having her direction and guidance from God.

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.171&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 171</a>



            
                
            
            And now she found the comfort of his service and the hopes of
                the rewards of his grace, which he gave her through out the course
                of her life and felt the sweetness of influences upon her
                 soul; for which she most humbly rendered all the powers and
                 faculties of her heart in thanks and praise to his name and
                mercy forever.
            
            
    
            She poured out her fervent, admirable prayers to her God
                 for all her children and relations, begging for each particular child those graces and gifts they wanted, and forgiveness to all who had anyway wronged or injured
                her in all her life (naming some — who had more nearly and
                highly wronged and grieved her — with the <span class="evquote">bowels of compassion</span>
                 for the good of their souls that they may repent and be forgiven
                 and received to mercy in his kingdom <span class="evquote">where all 
        [heart]
    s are 
                 united in the holy band of charity</span>).
            
                As to my own private concerns, she petitioned God that
                 I might  find comfort in my husband's family
                 and be rewarded with the same blessing that God had been graciously
                 pleased to give me in my children, as she was pleased to say
                 I had been to her. And that I might be strengthened by his 
                 grace to endure those afflictions with patience which I must
                 find in this world after her death, and that I might have hope
                 in God's mercies that he would lay no more on me than he would
                 enable me to undergo and that they were signs of his love to me.
                 And that I must not grieve too much for her loss, since the Lord had
                 continued her so long to me; for he could make up her loss
                in a greater comfort by giving me a son which I wanted, and
                 that I was then with child of one; wished me continue as I
                 had begun and then we should receive each other with joy in
                 heaven which she was confident of through the merits of Jesus Christ,
                according to his speech to St John, '<span class="evquote">Be thou faithful and I will
                 give thee a crown of life</span>', with abundance of other heavenly,
                 rich expressions that I am not able to write down.
            She told me she had fully finished her will and settled her
                 estate according as she
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.172&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 172</a>



            
                 
            
                desired, and she hoped with a good conscience settling all
                 she had in such a manner as would breed no trouble. And
                 that she hoped her son, Christopher, would be satisfied
                with it because she had not been awanting in the discharge
                 of a good conscience towards him ever since he was born 
                (by taking pains with him and care of him in his minority,
                 and disbursing the greater part of her widow's estate
                 upon him or for his brother John, or the other part of
                 Kirklington, whereby he had the benefit of her maintaining the children). And that now he would let me enjoy with
                 my husband and children what she had done for us,
                considering my husband's estate needed it and he was
                heir of a great, large estate of his father's, and by her
                 death that jointure came in clear to him. All which estate
                 would amount to yearly to him in England and Ireland
                 £3000 which she prayed God to bless to
                 him and his posterity that they might enjoy it in righteousness
                 so long as the moon and sun endureth.
            And now, she said, '<span class="evquote">I have done my work and finished my
                 course which the Lord had given me to do</span>; <span class="evquote">henceforth,
                 I hope is laid up for me a crown of glory which the Lord
                 shall give me, and not only to me but for all those that love
                     the Lord Jesus and his appearing</span>'.</span><span class="event" id="ev120-start">
            
                About Thursday night, she sent for her children to
                 take her last farewell in this life. When Mr Thornton
                 and myself came, with our two children, Alice and Katherine,
                she desiring my husband to pray with and for her as he had
                done several times in which she was much pleased and satisfied, ever joining most devoutly, reverently praying with
                 her heart and soul in each petition, finding great joy
                 and refreshment upon such occasions.
            After which prayer she embraced us all severally in her
                 arms and kissed us, pouring out many prayers and blessings
                for us all, <span class="evquote">like good old Jacob — when he gave his last

                blessing to his children</span> — she begged of God Almighty
                 for us all; after which, I took the saddest last leave of my
                     dear and honoured mother as ever child did to part with 
                 so great and excellent a parent and infinite comfort.
            And yet, the great grief I had was increased by 
                 reason of her exceeding torment which she endured, which
                 made me more willingly submit to part with her, who
                 I saw endured much pains and extremity, not desiring she should long endure that which it was the pleasure of
                 God for the exercise of her patience to lay on her.
                 Also, when she see me weep much, for this affliction of
                 hers, did indeed concern me nearly.
            She said, 'Dear child, why will you not be willing
                 to part with me to God? Has he not lent me to be a comfort
                 to you long enough? Oh, part with me freely, as I desire to
                 enjoy my saviour in heaven; do not be unwilling that 
                 I should be delivered from this miserable world. Give
                me willingly and freely to him that lent me thus long and be
                 contented in everything. You never have been disobedient to me in all your life. I pray thee obey me in                this that <span class="evquote">you submit cheerfully to the wise and good determination of our good God </span>. And fill your heart with spiritual
                comfort instead of this: in me, he takes to himself. <span class="evquote">And
                 so, the blessing of God Almighty be upon the head of you and
                 yours forever. Amen</span>'.
            Certainly, the words of a dying friend prevails much
                 and I do believe the Lord had put words of persuasion into
                 her mouth, which prevailed more than all the world with me to
                 moderate my excessive sorrow and build me up in hopes, as
                 she said, of our meeting again, never to part, which so 
                 happened: for I was, after this, even desirous, that if it were
                 the determinate pleasure of God to take her from my head,
                 that I might patiently submit when he should free that sweet
                 soul from all those burdens of pressures and extremities.

            It pleased God she continued until Saturday. About
                 noon, she spoke to my uncle Norton and, recommending
                 myself and all her children to his care with much
                 good prayers for him and his, she then took her leave 
                 of him. About four o'clock my aunt Norton came to 
                see her, when she saluted her gladly, bidding her,  'welcome, dear sister'. What comfort is it to me to see my
                dear and honoured husband's sister with her at that time,
                 there ever having been a strict league of affection and
                 friendship betwixt them. She was then come to see her make
                 her last end and scene of her life, whom she had known
                 near 40 years, and so took her solemn farewell of her.</span><span class="event" id="ev121-start">
                
                 I forgot to declare that, about Wednesday before, she called
                 for her last will (it being made a year before that) and
                made it be read all over before her: confirming and
                 ratifying the same, and publicly declared the same to be
                 her last will and testament before my husband and myself and many other witnesses, making the same to be
                endorsed on the back of her will, et cetera.</span><span class="event" id="ev122-start">
            To return to her last actions in this life. About
                 six o'clock at night, this sweet saint of God began
                 to be speechless, having still all that time employed that 
                 tongue in nothing but prayers, praises and petitions to
                 God, with most heavenly spiritual and pathetical
                 recommendations of herself to the Lord, ever saying,
                 'Come, Lord Jesus, make haste and receive my soul'
                 and at the last, immediately before her speech failed,
                 'Lord Jesus, <span class="evquote">into thy hands I commend my spirit</span>'.
            And when it failed, still lifting up to heaven her
                 eyes and hands to God. And Daphne perceived she
                 drew her breath short and going to depart, prayed her
                that she would give them that was with her  some
                 signs that she found <span class="evquote">the comfort of God's spirit</span> in her
                 soul with a taste of the joys of heaven.

           Which she immediately did — to all their great comforts —
                 for she lifted up both her eyes and hands steadfastly
                 to heaven three times, distinctly, one after another.
                And closing her hands herself, then laid down her
                 head and her eyes:
                 
                 this holy saint and matron of true
                 piety sweetly fell asleep in the Lord between the hours
                 of eight and nine o'clock at night, upon Saturday the 10th of
                 December 1659. </span> Being the day of her coronation, I 
                 hope, in heaven with her Father, receiving that welcome of 
                 '<span class="quote">Come the blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom he has
                 prepared for you</span>'.
             '<span class="quote">For I was an hungry and ye fed me; naked and ye clothed

                 <span class="quote">inasmuch as ye did it unto these, ye did it unto me</span>'.
            And I hope she is now <span class="quote">entered into the joy of her Lord</span>.

            My brother, Christopher Wandesford, was then at London,
                 where he was writ to inform him both of her sickness
                 and death. Her funeral was solemnised with as much
                 handsomeness as those times would afford and considering
                the condition we were in (the soldiers having been quartered
                amongst us) though not according to her worth and quality.
            She was interred upon Tuesday the 13th of December following,
                 in the chief place in her own quire at Catterick Church
                 (she, having repaired the same all that summer at her
                 own charges to the value of above £20).
            Her corpse was carried out of her house by the Lord
                Darcy, his son, Colonel Darcy, Sir Christopher Wyvill, Baronet,
                 and diverse other persons and kindred of quality.
            Then, from Hipswell Green, her tenants took her and
                so carrying her to the town of Catterick, where the ministers —
                who was appointed by her own nomination — carried
                her into the church and, after sermon, laid her in her grave.
            
            The ministers' names were these:  Mr Peter Samways, Mr
                 Kearton, Mr Farrer, Mr Edrington, Mr Binlows, Mr Robinson,
                Mr Smith, Mr Brockill and Mr Parkes. Infinite numbers of
                 poor were served by dole at the door (above 1,500 besides in the
                church of Catterick). </span>

            This blessed mother of mine was thus gathered into her grave: having lived many peaceable years
                 together with my father, brought him a competent
                 number of children; being the support of his house and
                 family, preserving it and the branches under her care
                 and prudence; living his chaste wife and widow for
                 above 19 years.
            Her whole age wherein she lived was 60
                and seven years, and 11 months and odd days,
                 so that she died in a good old age: full of good works
                and virtue and honour to all of her family and country.
                 To the Lord's most infinite majesty be all glory
                 and praise for his great goodness and mercy extended
                 to me and us all; through this dear parent of ours,

                 bestowed upon her that we may be the better capable

            All the way, as he came out of Scotland from following the
                 factious army of Lambert through each county, was he
                 alarmed with their cries and petitions; hoping thereby that
                 this might be the best way to establish peace in church and
                state and reestablish the king in his throne in honour and safety.
            Thus, by the infinite goodness of God, this was effected accordingly; for, immediately after that parliament was
                called and set, they voted with great alacrity, his majesty's
                return in honour and safety to his kingdom after 12 years
                 banishment or thereabouts.</span> And now the 
        [heart]
    s and tongues of
                 all faithful, loyal people in these kingdoms was even full
                 of joy and admiration, not knowing how to show forth their
                 exceeding content and satisfaction with gratitude to the great
                 and eternal God of Gods and king of kings, who had delivered
                our souls and bodies from those thraldoms, restoring his true
                 and faithful doctrine and his vicegerent upon earth to us,
                 which requires our utmost possibility of thanks and praise to our
                 great Lord whom we serve. Oh, that our hearts might never
                 forget what he hath done for us in restoring our king, our
                 priests, our prophets to this our <span class="quote">land of our nativity</span> but adore
                 the glorious name of Jehovah forever. Amen.

            Lord shouldest have been extreme; nay, if thou hadst not
                 overlooked these abominations for thy holy son's sake,

                truly and unfeignedly thankful to thy divine goodness

                 his father's kingdom thus quietly and peaceably

                 miracles of thy love and free grace, as also by thy corrections,

                 with justice and piety, so do thou hear the requests of
                 his lips, grant him the desire of his heart in thy true faith

            Therefore, to thee, <span class="quote">the Lord most high</span>, do I humbly prostrate

                 thou pleased to hear the petitions of my soul and hast again reestablished thy truth and holy word and sacraments
                 freely for thy servants to enjoy thee therein with joy and delight,
                 and hast restored thy servant, our dear king, to be a patron
                 and defender of thy church and its members. Let us all be so, also,

            After my strength was again recruited through God's
                 mercy for travail, we removed with my husband and those
                 children the Lord had blessed me with (Alice, my second and
                then eldest, and Katherine, my fourth child) and came to Oswaldkirk, living a fortnight at my sister Denton's
                house until our own in that town was ready.
         Then we got to it — with all my dear mother's household
             stuff, which was brought thither — where we lived two years
                 after I had taken leave of my own country and dear
                 friends and relations, parting with them with a sad heart
                 amongst whom I had lived many comfortable years.
            But God was pleased to go along with me in a strange place
                 making me to find many sweet influences of his favour
                 (both in sickness and in health) and giving me comfort of
                 my husband's friends instead of my own. And to find a
                 great deal of favour amongst strangers where I lived,
                so that in all places and at all times and upon all occasions,
                I have daily fresh cause and occasions to admire the infinite
                 goodness of that God whom I serve; desiring to speak well of
                 his name, who has pity upon his weak servant.
         
    
            Here I lived for two years until our own house at East
                 Newton could be finished, which we had been in building
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.185&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 185</a>



            
                 
            
            several years before my dear mother's death which, if we
                 could have finished before, she would gladly have lived
                 with us here but it was not begun time enough for that.</span>
        <span class="event" id="ev137-start">
         
                In this time, while we were at Oswaldkirk, my brother
                    Denton preached there and did that with much gravity and piety,
                 being indeed a very excellent, good and wise man, from whom all
                 our family had received many assistances and helps from
             by way of advice. And chiefly my husband, who depended
                 much on his counsel after our coming thither.</span>
        <span class="event" id="ev137a-start">
            But he, having some scruples, did not conform to the now
                established government of the church, so that he did leave
                 that church after a while and retired to live with us at
                 Newton. I confess his nonconformity did much trouble me
                 and <span class="evquote">I endeavoured with my small mite to discourse that business</span>.
                 But I suppose he had been otherwise ordained then episcopal,
                 so that it was fruitless to persuade; otherwise, it might 
                 have been better for us all, though he was ever of a quiet and
                 peaceable temper, free from faction or disturbances of the
                 state. And indeed, I enjoyed much comfort in his ministry
                 and great assistance as toward the building of our house at
                 Newton
                </span>

                (Mr Thornton not giving himself to take pleasure
                 or trouble in anything of that nature: being much addicted
                 to a melancholic humour which had seized on him by fits
                 for several years before he was 20 years old).
            Nevertheless, after the use of great means (which God directed
                me in by Dr Wittie, et cetera, as leeches and gentle course of physic,
                 spring and fall as there was occasion) ever since we were
                 married those were much abated. And he oftener was in a
                 more cheerful frame of spirit than formerly as both he 
                 and his friends has often-times acknowledged to my great 
                 comfort, whose utmost endeavours and care was ever to 
                 study his good and satisfaction in whose life and welfare my
                 own did much subsist. Yet, after his house was done and we
                 in it, he took much content in it when he was well. </span>

         In this time while I lived there, about Shrove Sunday 1661,
             
             I was in the church when it was a frost and snow; sitting in the minister's
             pews, I felt myself exceeding cold and, by fits, continued until the
                 Tuesday following very ill.</span>

      <p id="div-081">
        <span class="event" id="ev139-start"> 
            I began a dangerous sickness, which brought me very nigh
                 to death at Oswaldkirk (after my dear mother's death)
                 which was caused by that cold I got and agueish temper on the
                     Sunday in the church, causing a very violent vomiting,
                coming greatly upon Shrove Tuesday, February 13, 1661, being
                that day my birthday.
            And so, continuing perpetually in pain and vomiting
                 until I was not able to receive any kind of sustenance,
                 being then fallen into an intermitting fever; so that, at
                 five days end, I was compelled to send for Dr Wittie.
             He saw cause to let me blood, giving me many cordials
                 to strengthen the stomach, but nothing would stay with me
                 until I drank a draught of cold water, which more refreshed
                 my thirsty soul than all what art could give. 
            That night, being the 17th of February, I did verily believe 
                 should be my last in this life; I being brought into an
                 exceeding weakness and feebleness of body and spirit
                 but most of all into a seeming spiritual desertion 
                from God, which was not to be long endured without sinking
                 under the pressures of the divine displeasure. Which I apprehended, in this my weakness, my eternal state to be in a 
                 lost condition by reason of my sins and Satan's 
                 accusing me falsely from my sorrows and temporal sufferings,
                 casting multitude of doubtings into my heart. As that:
                 surely, <span class="evquote">I did not belong to God</span>, and I was not his servant
                 because <span class="evquote">he followed me with such crosses, afflictions, sickness
                 and troubles in this world which seemed to be curses rather than
                 such trials as he used to lay upon those that were his children</span>.
            
            And that I had <span class="evquote">neglected all those offers and tenders of mercy
                 in his word and sacraments</span> which he, from time to time, had given
                 me from my youth up in the examples, instructions and admonitions from my dear parents and from his ministers; all his
                 great deliverances and checks, and calls of his spirit with his
                 spiritual and temporal preservations of me innumerable.
                 Yet, said Satan, all these had not wrought a through conversion and change of heart in me to walk according to the motions
                 of God's spirit with that strictness I ought to have done, and that, though

            I had been kept from the falling into any enormous sins,
                 yet for the least omission of duties or small offences against God or man eternal damnation was due, and that
                 now it was too late to repent or hope because I had neglected  or driven it so long that my life was at an end.
            For aught I know this was my last summons and that, although God was able to have mercy upon me, yet I had
                so often failed my promises and fallen into sins and forgetfulness of God that he now would not have mercy on me
                 at the last hour, as Satan would have persuaded me.
                 These, with many arguments against my poor soul, did
                 <span class="evquote">the old serpent</span> seek to destroy my hopes of mercy, and my
                 own weakness and melancholy forming against myself
                 (joining with Satan) in fears because of my unworthiness
                 or ingratitude.
            Lo, in this most sad and heavy condition was I in: not
                 having any soul living that I could open my griefs and thoughts to, nor receive any comfort for my dejected
                 heavy spirit. For that time, Mr Thornton was himself in a sad
                 condition and very melancholy, full of trouble of spirit, nor
                 would I acquaint him lest I should be an aggravation of
                 his trouble. And alas, what could I say in this exigent?
                When the God of mercy by his corrections severe had 
                seemed to forsake me and withdraw his presence; the devil
                accusing — <span class="evquote">as he is termed the accuser of the brethren</span> — my
                 conscience could not excuse me from too many failings.
            My sickness and weakness threatening my desolation each
                 minute and <span class="evquote">I had none to give me spiritual comfort</span>
                 and <span class="evquote">my soul was sad even to the death</span>. Yet, in this exigent,
                 whither <span class="evquote">could I fly for relief but to that great God which made
                 heaven and Earth</span>? I desired to cast myself solely at his
                 feet of mercy; yea, before the throne of the most gracious God
                 <span class="evquote">in whom I live, and move, and have my being</span>, saying with 
                Esther
                
                    
                    
                if <span class="evquote">I perish, I perish</span>. <span class="evquote">Here I am, Lord: though thou 
                 shouldest kill me, yet will I trust in thee for healing, 
                 pardoning, strengthening grace and mercy</span>. Immediately upon
                 these thoughts, it pleased him in a wondrous manner to begin to give me some comfort from sinking in my hopes, and to
                 stay myself on him when I was almost past hopes by reason
                 of my weakness. This I obtained out of that

            blessed portion of scripture which our dear saviour spake
                in St Matthew, the 11th chapter, and 28-30 verses
                 which, like the
                 lightning breaking into a dark place, thus it pierced
                 into the secret darkness of my sorrowful heart and dejected
                 soul; bringing refreshment and some hopes of relief and comfort
                 being increased in the consideration of those heavenly mercies
                 contained in that scripture. Looking upon this as his sweet
                and effectual call to my soul, wherein he then bid me, come
                 unto him and alone seek of him that had strength, power and mercy
                 to relieve all poor, sinful, dejected souls which laboured and 
                 were heavy laden with sins the saddest burden then to be born:
                 '<span class="evquote">Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
                 and I will give you rest</span>'.
            Behold, the handmaid of the Lord: I laboured under and was
                 <span class="evquote">heavy laden with the burden of my sins</span> under the burden of
                 Satan's bondage and slavery of fears. The one bringing me towards despair, the other of torment, persuading that time was
                 past for any help from God; that the devil might wreak his ancient
                 malice against souls on me in my sickness and weakness
                 then, being the fittest opportunity to prevail when he shakes
                their faith. <span class="evquote">But, lo, in this my distress</span>, <span class="evquote">the lion of the 
                    tribe of Judah</span> put to flight for me, <span class="evquote">as he had done for himself when he tempted him to question his sonship, the
                 Prince of darkness, with this word of his, 'Come unto me</span>'; showing thereby that he was a liar and that it was not too late for me
                 to repent and believe, nor him to accept of my soul. And so,
                 by this, he vanquished his strongest stratagem by which he
                 surpriseth the poor, doubting Christian, when at the lowest ebb
                this he trieth; if by any means he can make him doubt or
                 question the rich goodness that is eternally in God as his very
                 being, and <span class="evquote">so commit the great sin against his mercy</span> from
                whence flows man's salvation and then, he is lost forever.
            But at this time, when I was weakest, <span class="evquote">Christ Jesus, the righteous</span> came into my heart, <span class="evquote">with healing under his wings</span>,
                 making it appear that Satan was a liar and that he never refuseth
                 any who come unto him, according to that place of <span class="evquote">those that
                 come unto me I will in no wise cast off</span>. He calls, he invites,
                 he persuades sinners to come unto him. He it was that give me

            this word and set it home by his spirit; to stay my
                 drooping heart, even ready to faint and perish for want
                 of spiritual food. Behold, I was weary with the burden of
                 sin and he said, 'Come'. I was faint and heavy laden; he
                 said 'Come'. Lord, I come, but to whom must I come for relief?
                 <span class="evquote">Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I
                 will give you rest</span>. O Lord, if thou art pleased to call all
                 that labour and are weary with their sins and temptations of
                 Satan, I see no reason why I should not come with my sadness and burdens for thou hast promised to give me rest.
            Alas, O Lord God, I need it and want it: I almost sink under thy heavy hand of displeasure. <span class="evquote">I cry unto thee out
                 of the whale's belly of despair</span>, if thou help not. <span class="evquote">O God,
                 the father of heaven have mercy upon me. O Christ, the
                 redeemer of the world, have mercy upon me. O holy, blessed
                 and glorious spirit, have pity on me. O most glorious Trinity,
                 three persons and one God</span>, help thy poor, distressed, weak handmaid  plunged in the depth of sin and misery: for the least, without repentance  and thy mercy, is in its own nature damnable
                 and none but thy own almighty power is able to help,
                 deliver and save me from the jaws of <span class="evquote">this lion who goes about
                 seeking to devour</span> and make a prey of my soul. And as thy
                 wisdom and free grace, O blessed Trinity, did set thyself on 
                 work by and through mercy to the sons of men, and by almighty 
                power to find out a way for man's redemption and of thy 
                free grace, thou, O my dear saviour, suffered the wrath of thy 
                 Father on the cross to purchase our salvation, so now art thou
                 pleased to vanquish my grand enemy by the power of thy 
                 word to me. <span class="evquote">I believe (Lord, help my unbelief)</span> that thou 
                 art as merciful to me as others, and wilt not exclude me except
                 I exclude myself. And as thou hast pleased to give me plenty of
                 calls and comforts, who in my sad hour was <span class="evquote">a God of compassion</span>,
                so thou hast given me grace to come unto thee. I come, O Lord, to 
                 thee and hang on thy mercy, with all the powers and faculties of my
                heart and soul for the pardoning my sin and <span class="evquote">to strengthen my faith
                    though weak in body</span>; yet, with an unfeigned hope of thy 
                 goodness and sweetest clemency that it will not be in vain this,
                 thy word, came unto me. This is from thy goodness, when I was
                 in sorrow to let me see that the time was not past when thou calls
                 to come unto thee.

            Thou most sweetly, like a <span class="evquote">loving father</span>, showing me the way to
                 life everlasting at that present when  my heart was in doubting.
                 Then to call unto me, thus, is a mercy transcending my capacity,
                 and <span class="evquote">withal to tell me that whom thou lovest, those thou chastenest
                 every son whom thou receivedst</span>. And, therefore, I may not
                 question thy precious love, though never so sadly afflicted.
                 I come, O Lord, my God, and <span class="evquote">willingly take up thy sweet
                 yoke</span> and desire to follow thee: <span class="evquote">my light, my path, my way</span>.
                 Oh, learn me to be <span class="evquote">patient, meek and lowly in heart</span>, to submit
                 to thy dispensations: <span class="evquote">for thy burden is light</span> but my sins
                 are heavy. Yea, thy ways is wisdom and pleasantness in
                 <span class="evquote">perfect freedom</span>. Let me, now thou hast set my feet at
                 liberty, make thee forever my pattern, my comfort, my joy,
                 my life and direction, so shall I find rest to my soul.
            Rest. Oh, how sweet is that word to my languishing soul.
                 Oh, let me find rest from sinning, from offending thee anymore.
                 It is too much that I have spent so many of my years in
                 doing so little for thee. Let me now work for thee, while thou
                 hast put an opportunity of life into my hand, love thee and
                 delight in thee, and fear nothing but thee, spending the remainder of my days to the glory of thy name. Not sinning
                by an <span class="evquote">unprofitable life</span>, nor give Satan any advantage
                 to tempt my soul to despair by remissness in duties. And this, I humbly beg,
                 with the return of my health and strength, if thou seest it fit
                for Jesus Christ, his sake, <span class="evquote">the great shepherd and bishop of my 
                 soul</span>. In whose name, I further say as he has taught me, 
                <span class="evquote">'Our father'</span>. Amen.

            After this inestimable and wonderful mercy in my gracious God's giving me satisfaction in my doubts, and in putting to flight that <span class="quote">old serpent, the devil</span>, from doing more harm to my soul than scaring me into the firmer and deeper-rooted assurance that the God, whom I feared and served in what
                 measure I could, was of so infinite a goodness, I was bound
                 to believe his word: that, <span class="quote">at what time soever a sinner repenteth him of his sins from the bottom of his

            Which I hope he, at that time, gave me a great experience of
                 and was pleased to suffer my soul to receive comfort and
                 <span class="quote">lifted the light of his countenance upon me</span>; making me
                 to enjoy a great share of peace of conscience and joy in his
                 salvation; with the refreshings of my spirit in the testimony
                 of his love, insomuch that all fears of dying were taken
                 away, and then I was more willing to depart when he called
                 than to live <span class="quote">in this vale of sin and misery</span>, if the Lord should
                 see it fit.
            But lo, I asked spiritual and the Lord gave me great
                 addition of temporal mercies, filling my mouth and soul
                 with abundant gladness and praise, when I looked for nothing
                 but death and destruction; showing that the mercies of the eternal
                 God are not to be measured by the weak apprehensions of men
                 but admired and adored in all his wisdom, goodness and free

                 brought so exceeding weak in my sickness.
            But, within a quarter after, I found myself with quick child

                ground, it pleased God to give us all leave, with our
                 family and two daughters, to come to live at it, being
                 so finished as to dwell therein about the midst of June
                 1662. I, being then great with child, walked from Oswaldkirk with our company, having a great deal of strength
                 and health given to me from God, blessed be his holy name.
                Also, he gave us a comfortable settlement at our own house,
                 which I got ready furnished with what my dear mother gave
                 me in five days' time and all the ground stocked with her cattle.</span><span class="event" id="ev142-start">
            After which, within a little of our coming to house, Mr
                Thornton was called to London by Nettleton's business,
                 going purposely to prevent the breaking up an execution against him from that Nettleton against his estate
                
                for a debt of my father's, which Mr Thornton had been advised by some to secure out of his own estate and to engage for it. So, until he could receive the monies from
                 Ireland out of my father's estate there, which was by his
                 lease for 41 years appointed to pay all debts, legacies
                 and portions in feoffee in trusts hands,</span><span class="event" id="ev142a-start">and he had been advised
                 formerly to take upon him the management of it from 
                 my uncle, Mr Norton, by way of assignment and to pay
                 those things chargeable thereupon. But, albeit there was
                 a good estate (which was £1000 per annum)
                 there, from whence
                 these debts should arise, yet it was altogether against
                 my dear mother's, or my own judgement or advice, that he
                 should take upon him so great a trouble as that must be:
                 both in regard that neither his purse nor person was suiting such 
                 an enterprise, being in another nation (so a hazard to
                 his person) and likewise not suited in other respects to withstand the disputes, which she foresee would arise from some
                 that were concerned for themselves. Nor was there the least 
                necessity for him to engage in it for gaining my £1000 there,
                 by reason both that and all other rights and dues which could be
                challenged by my mother and myself, were sufficiently
                secured to us by my dear father's last will and deeds, and
                 none could prejudice us therein, whatever sinister pretentions were made by others whose advice he unhappily

            followed (as it afterwards appeared). And besides, my
                 English portion was sufficiently and undoubtedly safe and secured to him  of £1500 by the will and lease from my uncle, William
                     Wandesford, out of Kirklington, and by articles three partite
                 before my marriage betwixt my uncle Wandesford, my brother
                 Christopher, and myself securing both the £1500 and the £1000 out
                 of Ireland in its due order to be paid.</span><span class="event" id="ev143-start">
            But it so happened that he was advised — without our knowledge
                    or consent as aforesaid — to engage to Nettleton, as well as
                 to the business of the assignment for a debt of £1000 payable
                    out of his own estate by statute, because Nettleton would
                    not accept of security out of Ireland nor stay until Mr Thornton
                 received it thence. But he prosecuted Mr Thornton with so much
                 violency and fierceness that he compelled him to borrow monies
                 to satisfy his clamour, and he had paid him £900 and
                    above, nor would he be satisfied because the bond was for a
                 £1000 and not being taken in by Mr Thornton, he sued for the whole
                    and for charges,

                 an opportunity when Mr Thornton was at London to have
                 dispatched it. He got an execution broke up and by his
                 own man, with four other bailiffs, came early in a morning to
                    seize upon all our goods, monies, plate, et cetera, until he were all
                 satisfied. At first, very stiffly demanded £800 then to
                 be paid but, at last, by my brother Denton's endeavours
                 (he knowing the debt was paid) prevailed to give them £200
                    which they would have or plate, et cetera, to that value. 
            This accident was very afflicting to me, in regard that I hoped
                Mr Thornton's being there would have prevented it, and being
                 big with child, the grief I had with the fright and the rudeness
                 of those men had nigh gone to make me miscarry, what for
                 the injustice and unhandsomeness of that concern which came so suddenly on me in that business. Yet, the providence of God had so
                 ordered that there was £100 of Mr Thornton's newly (the week before ) come in and with £57 of my own (part of what my mother
                 gave me) that satisfied them at present. Or else, it might
                 have proved far worse with me then in that condition which if
                 I had wanted, peradventure, they might have taken my
                 bed from under myself and children, and those quick goods
                 my mother gave for our relief.

            I pray God forgive all those by whose evil counsel
                 my dear husband was brought into those snares: when
                 he intended most good to all parties in the acceptance of
                 the assignment, and the very troubles, vexations and afflictions it carried along in the whole course of transactions
                often times brought us into straits and great danger of my
                 life, proving one sad ingredient to my other sorrows.
            
    
                And indeed, I did fear some hard measure to fall
                 unawares to Mr Thornton and partly told him my conjecture , offering to pay Nettleton off with those monies my mother gave
                me before he went to London. But he, good man, did not believe
                 nor could imagine that he might find such treachery in
                 those lawyers he employed.</span>
            
            Yet did my suspicion prove a means in part to arm me with
                 patience to overcome that trouble when it came. Thus, have
                 I upon every occasion and act of my life, fresh cause to
                 speak good of the Lord, my God: <span class="quote">who, though he pleaseth
                 to suffer me to have afflictions of several sorts, yet with
                 the affliction he maketh a way to escape, and does not 
                 permit more to come on me than he gives me strength and
                 assistance to go through</span>.
            Therefore, will I give thanks unto his glorious name and
                 speak of his praise in the <span class="quote">land of the living</span> who hath not
                 yet given me over to death and bonds. And I beseech his
                 mercy that, for whatever trouble I endure here from men 
                 through oppression or injure, <span class="quote">he will endow me with a
                     double portion of his grace</span> here to serve him with a free 
        [heart]
    
                 and patient spirit, and giving a competency of these outward
                 enjoyments for ourselves and children in this life, if it be
                 his pleasure not to be burdensome to others. And, in the end,
                 to be our portion and our inheritance forever. Amen.

            Since the sad and dismal times of distraction in church

            word and sacraments, but especially of the latter which, with
                the use of our <span class="evquote"> Lord's Prayer,</span> was wholly laid aside as under the
                notion of relics of idolatry and popish superstition;
                 so that, lest we should offend God by serving him in his own
                 way and command (superstitiously) and pray to him in his
                own words, there was found out another manner of
                 worship: by presenting to his majesty prayers continually out of our own brain composed (and that without premeditation too often) and the <span class="evquote">Lord's Prayer</span> was by too many
                 despised as dry and insipid, by others neglected out of a
                compliance with the times. Also, the Holy Sacrament, which
                 was the testimonial of the highest act of our saviour's love to us,
                 lost men, was had in contempt as useless to the church of
                 Christ through some men's high-flown purity and gifts,
                imagining themselves above those ordinances who was
                 come already into the state of perfection.
            In what a condition, then, may it be thought the true church of 
                 God was herein, in England, and the members thereof, when we 
                 were cut off from the comfort and joy we received in and by
                 the holy and reverent use of these transcendent ordinances:
                 given and appointed as his last will and testament to us and all
                 his who should 
                 
                
                be 
                
                partakers of the benefit of salvation
                 through his bloodshed. And the breach of his loving command,
                 <span class="evquote">do this in remembrance of me</span>, when in and by the use thereof, it
                 was 
                  
                
                the comfort
                
                 and confirmation of all that holy martyrs and 
                 saints of God which suffered persecution for the testimony of the
                 gospel of Christ.
            
    
            No wonder, then, if we were brought into such plagues and
                 confusion in this land, whose pride was so great and devotion so dead. But we, who thirsted after these <span class="evquote">waters of life</span>,
                 did still, all these times (after my dear mother came to Hipswell  as well as at Westchester) enjoyed this blessing through
                 the mercy of God, even all the time of my mother's life to my
                 exceeding great satisfaction and comfort. But, after her death
                 and my coming from St Nicholas into my own house at
                 East Newton, which was above two whole years, I had not
                 had any opportunity of receiving.

            For there was not then any minister at Stonegrave which
                 did administer the Sacrament, nor had done there for
                many years; so that I was holy destitute of an opportunity
                to perform that comfortable, refreshing duty which my soul
                 longed for and grieved much for the want thereof (and withal being in such a languishing condition as I formerly
                mentioned, without any spiritual help from men). 
            After which, drawing near within a month of my delivery,
                 it behoved me to look with a more narrow search into my
                 soul and examine how my thoughts and desires were inclined
                to accept of death, whose time of life here very probably
                 might be short: this was my seventh child which the Lord had given
                 me to conceive. (I had more strong apprehensions of my
                 change in regard it was both my husband's mother's number and my own.) This did more lively persuade that, as death waited at all times, yet more reason for us to expect
                 it at these strange and miraculous times of childbearing,
                especially as they have been to me — more than many others —
                 motives of examination of my estate and condition spiritual (of the growth or decay of Christian graces which God
                 had wrought in me by reason of my several trials and sorrows came on me in the whole course of my life, and whether
                 I had returned due thanks to God for the same and removal
                 of his hand of afflictions in my deliverances).
            Upon which, I found that for the want of these holy ordinances,
                 and that by sad experience, that these troubles of the world 
                had interrupted or diverted my free communion and close
                 walking with God; as he had required of us not to be taken
                 of from his service and precepts for any worldly enjoyment
                 whatever, nor crosses should be my hindrance. But alas,
                 such was my weakness that I had broken those solemn vows
                 of baptismal and sacramental too frequently, through
                 <span class="evquote">negligence, ignorance</span>, wilful sins and worldly employments.
                 So that I had impulses upon my heart and great desires to renew this grand strengthening and quickening and confirming
                 ordinance of our dear saviour: <span class="evquote">desiring in all true and unfeigned repetance</span>, <span class="evquote">faith, hope and charity</span> to be made
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.197&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 197</a>



            
                 
            
                <span class="evquote">a partaker of this comforting and confirming Holy Sacrament
                 which our Lord Jesus Christ left us as his dearest pledge of his
                 love and free grace</span>: <span class="evquote">who laid down his life for sinners that
                 sinned not</span>; <span class="evquote">who became poor that we might be made rich
                 through his grace and righteousness</span>, <span class="evquote">making a new covenant</span>.
                 But I could not obtain this happiness in regard that the ministers had not given it on this side during the wars, nor was
                 it again established here since the coming in of the king. 
                 Neither, indeed, had we any minister settled at Stonegrave, our
                 parish church, which was a great grief to me that had never been so
                long deprived of all these public ordinances, nor was I in
                 a condition to travel any whither. So that I called to mind
                 that good man, Dr Samways, who had given the Sacrament last
                 to my blessed mother, desiring his company at Newton for that
                 necessity. Who, accordingly came, with Mr Browne and diverse
                 others, with whom and my dear husband, we did receive the
                 pledge, I hope, of our salvation in that Supper of the Lord.</span>
      </p>
      <p id="div-085">
            
                 Through which means, <span class="quote">I was much comforted, helped, enlivened, and quickened</span> from that black veil of unbelief which clouded my hopes of eternal salvation. This most excellent and
                 spiritual mercy was not the least but greatest I apprehended to receive from God; far surpassing all temporals, as
                 eternity does this finite beings of ours. Oh, that my heart
                 would break in pieces at the joyful remembrance of his renewing grace, favour and mercy wherein God was pleased to become my reconciled God in and through my dear redeemer's
                 bloodshed upon the cross. <span class="quote">And that my soul might forever
                 sing unto him hallelujahs of praise in heaven, with angels and
                 archangels and all the host of heaven</span>. I, here, prostrate my 
                soul before the <span class="quote">throne of grac</span>e which hath showed me — his poor, 
                weak handmaid — such hopes, such mercies, spiritual and 
                 opportunities of <span class="quote">making my calling and election sure</span>. And 
                he will, for his free grace's sake, fulfil in me the full perfection of
                 glory with him to behold the holy Trinity, with joy and admiration, and
                do his will perfectly which is impossible on earth for my weak,
                 human frailties and imperfections. O Lord, <span class="quote">free me from this
                     body of corruption</span> that I might serve thee in holiness all my
                 days. Amen.

            After I had received this great mercy from God, and
                 satisfaction to my poor, drooping soul in the participation
                of the Lord's Supper, as I mentioned (having endeavoured
                 to do it in the best manner and measure of faith, repentance
                 and charity prepared myself to meet my saviour therein
                 laying down my spiritual wants before him and craving
                 his graces to be fulfilled in me) I found a rich supply
                 according <span class="quote">to the power of his word that those that ever came unto him he would in no wise cast off</span>.
            So that through these testimonies most precious I was the

            And, in the second place, I counted it my duty to desire

                 not only breed scruples but were directly contrary to the said

                 This was neither known to nor mistrusted by my dear mother

                 my younger children for maintenance and portions, it was
                 sold for this debts; and also, with the disbursement of the
                 sum of £300 I laid out for the house, since my mother's death
                to assist him without of my own money for my children,
                 I had been further instrumental to his assistance in giving
                 leave that my £1000 to be received out of Ireland (which was
                 settled on me and my children by bond before marriage) should
                 go to the satisfaction of his brothers' and sisters' portions, which
                was not yet discharged and debts; so that, having thus disposed of
                 all my own portion from myself and children, together
                 with their estate for their provisions, I thought myself obliged in conscience to desire Mr Thornton should

            Albeit there wanted not some who, guided by self-interest, repined at anything which tended to the support
                 of Mr Thornton and his children, especially by me because I was
                not of their faction as I was told. Although I may, and do, appeal to
                 themselves whether I have not laid out myself and
                 fortune to secure all peoples' just rights from us if it were 
                 never so prejudicial to my own interest. And so may
                 hope for a blessing according to my good conscience and integrity, who having given to my husband's and friends' use and for
                 his debts, which I could no way be capable of  contracting
                 from my own children that which should be for their provision;
                 so that, had I not endeavoured some satisfaction for those
                 whom God had given me, I had been unworthy to have
                 borne the name of a mother, leaving them in such an unsettled estate and sad condition. Yea, even altogether unprovided for in this world , showing myself one of St Paul's
                 infidels: <span class="evquote">He that provideth not for them of his own house
                 hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel</span>.
            So, then let not others' uncharitable displeasure blame
                 what was done in this kind; since my dear husband was
                 pleased to show his love and affection to his faithful wife
                 and children (in answer to the noble fortune, as he called it,
                 that he had with me) whose trouble only was that his burdens
                 was so great that he was compelled to lessen his estate in
                 part to free the rest. Nor could he leave more for his younger children's maintenance and education and portions than 
                 Leysthorpe, which was about £100 per annum. And this did 
                 not satisfy those peoples' humours, as I was told
                 by my dear husband, because it was not charged
                 with debts first to precede my children's provision.
                 Albeit we had by mutual consent set over a debt
                 from Sir Christopher Wandesford, out of Ireland for seven years of
                 £200 per annum, which was by agreement to satisfy for
                my £1000 portion and the debt which my husband had paid
                to Nettleton. Also, the £1000 which was left of the sale of

            Burn Park was laid out in a rentcharge out of Mr
                 Laurence Sayer's land of £80 per annum. This was deputed for the debts: all which did amount to the sum of £3000
                 nor did the debts of Mr Thornton amount to that sum by
                 £600. Nevertheless, by the sequel of all, it did appear that
                 this just and honest action of ours did exasperate such
                 without a cause, who had desires that Leysthorpe (so well as
                 the rest of all his personal estate) should go for security
                 collateral to the rest. And by that means, nothing should
                 be left at certain for my poor younger children.
            The case seemed very hard to me and made me endeavour 
                 the more earnestly to prosecute this settlement, which yet I
                obtained with a grand difficulty by reason of these obstacles. But, at last, prevailed to have it done without the said
                 contingency; nor did I intend to alter the same without
                 great cause, which I hoped in God would not be because there
                 was so great a sum left for his debts, and was made believe it could not be cut off the entail without my consent
                 (but it proved afterward the contrary to my great grief
                 and almost my utter ruin and my children's).
            There was left only Newton, which was my jointure, settled
                 so on my heir that it could not be cut off without my consent
                 in passing a fine, nor was the rents ever more clear then
                 seven score paid a year of it.</span>
            
            And now, I heartily thank my gracious God, who gave me
                 opportunity to get this done for the satisfaction of my
                 conscience and the relief of my children. Blessed be his name
                 that did not take me out of this life before, lest by some
                 means they might have been disappointed. And I leave
                 both my husband and children all in the wise and gracious
                 disposition of the great God, humbly craving his blessing
                 upon them all for Christ's sake. Amen.

            with such excessive floods all that night that it was terrible
                 to behold to those about me, bringing me into a most desperate
                 condition, without hopes of life: spirits, soul and strength
                 seemed all gone from me.
            My dear husband and children and friends had taken their last
                 farewell. In this deplorable condition laid I in for several
                 hours together, not being able to utter one word. All the means
                could be was done in that fright, but did not prevail. After five hours torment,
                
                it pleased my gracious Lord to have compassion on his languishing creature and brought to my remembrance a powder which

             — through the mercy of my saviour who healeth and helped all that
                came unto him — by it helped me, so that the flux stayed by degrees
                 until Dr Wittie was come. When, after the use of other means, I
                 was delivered and spared at that time from that death so nigh,

                 of childbirth; and, lastly, this dreadful flux and infirmity  whereof very few doth escape with their lives.
                 O Lord, I beseech thee, except of my hearty pourings out
                 in prayer and praise and <span class="quote">let me live to magnify thy name</span>
                 for all these transcendent mercies, day and night. And let

            It pleased God to give me a new hopes of comfort
                 of bearing Mr Thornton another child, although
                 these are accompanied with thorny cares and troubles and
                  more to me than others. But, yet, I was continued in
                 much health and strength, after I had given suck to Robin,
                  all along until I was with child and until about a fortnight
                 before my delivery when my travail began upon me.</span><span class="event" id="evn6-start">
                 And then the pangs of childbearing, often remembering
                 me of that sad estate I was to pass and dangerous perils my
                 soul was to find, even by <span class="evquote">the gates of death</span>; so that, I, being
                 terrified with my last extremity, could have little hopes
                 to be preserved in this as to my own strength if my
                 strength were not in the Almighty.</span><span class="event" id="ev154-start">
            However, I trebled 
                 my diligence and care in preparation,
                 having with comfort received the blessed Sacrament as
                 a pledge of my redemption which we had the opportunity
                 of doing in our family, with Mr Thornton and his servants,
                 receiving it from Mr Comber, minister of the parish at
                Stonegrave. </span><a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.207&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 207</a>



            
                
            After this great mercy, in the renewing of our vows and
                covenants with God, I was fully satisfied in that condition —
                whether for life or death — <span class="quote">having committed my soul in
                 keeping to a faithful mediator and redeemer</span>; hoping
                <span class="quote">for me to live is Christ, and to die was gain</span>, when I should
                 <span class="quote">exchange sorrow for joy</span>, <span class="quote">and death for life and immortality</span>.
            <span class="event" id="ev155-start">
                 I was the most concerned for my poor children who might,
                 peradventure, want some helps from their weak mother
                 (and having no relation or friend of my own that might take
                 care of them) if their father should see cause to marry again. According, as I had been told, that it would be necessary
                for him for his health, I was indeed the more solicitous for
                my three young children; casting in my mind what friend of
                 my own to desire to intrust with their education, if he did so.
                 For my son, the hope of my house, I humbly committed him
                 into the protection of Almighty God, as also his two sisters,
                and for his education into the care of my dear and honoured uncle,
                 my Lord Frescheville; my daughter, Alice, to my dear aunt
                 Norton; and my daughter, Katherine, to my dear niece
                     Best, with strict charge to bring them up in the nurture and fear
                 of the Lord and the true profession of the protestant religion
                (as it was my faithful endeavours so to do, while I was with
                 them, that I might give a good account of their souls unto
                 my saviour). They had also a very good beginning of knowledge through the due examination  and catechising of Mr
                 Comber each Sabbath day, as well in the church as at home.</span>
            
            
    <span class="event" id="ev156-start">
            Next, in order, was it my duty to take care for the right
                 settlement and division of the goods and personal estate of my
                 dear mother, according to her will and testament, which she left
                 me power to do by deed amongst my children.
            Having left their maintenance and portions settled (as by the
                 deed made formerly) in as good a condition as could be for
                the many encumbrances and debts upon Mr Thornton's estate;
                so that it only remained for me to deposit the safe custody of
                 all the deeds, entails and writings about our whole estate
                 for our children into a safe hand, which in case of my mortality
                 should be delivered to my Lord Frescheville after my death.

            This was seriously considered and agreed upon — by and
                with the approbation and command of my dear husband —
                 that they should be delivered in keeping to Mr Comber
                 who, as a friend to all, should preserve them and give them
                 to my Lord Frescheville.
            Having entrusted all the chief concerns and evidences 
                 for my dear children within a little red leather trunk,
                 locked, I delivered the same to him according to our agreement
                 (laying a great charge and injunction, with my earnest desire)
                 that he would keep that trunk safe and, if it pleased
                 God to take me, then to deliver the same with his own hand
                 to my Lord (as I had charged the same to George Lightfoot and his wife Daphne with it, in my sickness of my son
                 I bore at St Nicholas after my mother's death;
                 for in it was contained all children's provision and subsistence, and if anything should happen to that trunk they
                 might be ruined). </span>
            
            
    <span class="event" id="ev157-start">
            It pleased my gracious Lord God to give me space and time
                 to do all these things as well as I could; after which, I fell
                 into travail (being one day and night in travail of
                 my eighth child). And then, it pleased the Lord to make me
                 happy in a goodly, strong child, a daughter, after an
                 exceeding sharp and perilous time;</span> <span class="event" id="ev158-start">being in the same condition of weakness after I came into bed and of my son,
                 Robert, which I escaped very narrowly the blow of death.
            But, by the providence of God, I was prepared with a remedy
                 which prevented the extremity, and within 14 days, I began
                 to be in a hopeful condition of recovery. Blessed be the

                comfort in my infant, with my dear husband and children,
                 who then had increased my number to four sweet children.</span>
                 O Lord, I beseech thee, accept the humble addresses of my
                 soul, body and spirit for these infinite mercies. Give me a

            But peradventure I might be too much lifted up by this 
                 mercy and, therefore, it seemed good to the divine providence to lay
                 a very sad affliction upon Mr Thornton and myself in a most
                 dangerous sickness seized upon him as he was returning 
                 from York in his way home, coming so near as the moor

                lamentable condition being made known to me, when
             I expected him each hour to have received him home with
             health and comfort, did so surprise my spirits that I was
             brought into a violent passion of grief and sorrow, with fits
             of swooning
                
             which I never knew before.
            And prevailed so exceedingly that I immediately went sick
             to bed, being so weak upon that occasion that all gave me for
             dead; so that it was an impossibility to carry me alive to
             see my dear husband, although I could not be pacified
             without it, until I fell so weak myself I could not speak.
            Thus, was I deprived of seeing or doing my faithful duty
             to my beloved husband through the Lord's hand upon myself in such extremity,</span> nor had they hopes of the sparing either of our lives in all appearance. Only our hopes
             was in the miraculous fountain of inexhaustible mercies
                of the almighty Lord God, <span class="quote">who turneth man to destruction, and saith turn again from the grave, ye children of
             men</span>.  Nor had I any comfort or friend that could
             assist me in my sorrows at that time (nor who to leave my
             four young children to, in that exigent of both our
             sad calamities) but only to the gracious <span class="quote">Father of mercies</span>

             my dear children then like to be left young orphans
             to the world of troubles.
            Yet, blessed be the Lord, who did not give us over to death
                 but, when we were nigh it, behold the goodness of God was
                 entreated for us to restore both our lives. And let me ever
                return him the glory of his power and mercy in the return of
                 our prayers, be ascribed to his majesty, who immediately
                 gave us hopes of recovery upon calling upon his name.

            It was the pleasure of our God to visit my dear child,
                 Joyce Thornton, with a great sickness, falling exceeding ill on
                 Sunday the 20th of January 1665, beginning, as we thought, with a
                 cold which struck in many red spots all over her body and face;
                 after which she mourned
              
                 and cried exceedingly, being tormented

            She continued with some intermissions of slumbers and in
                 much strength did resist the sickness until the Thursday after , when it was past hopes of recovery. And about one
              and two o'clock in the afternoon, on Friday the 27th, 
                     January 1665,

            It pleased God to deliver my daughter, Alice, from a surfeit
                 which brought her into a violent and dangerous illness, which came
                 upon her in her sleep as she laid in bed with me, when I wakened
                 suddenly in a fright with the noise she made; being almost

                After the drinking of Scarborough waters, Mr Thornton
                 sent for me to York about business with my Lord Frescheville

                 for the charging of Mr Raines and Mr Portington's debt of
                 £1400 by mortgage upon Leysthorpe. In so doing, there was

             which condition I could not but lament; nor had I got a sight
                 of this new disposition of that estate, which I do believe Mr
                 Thornton was partly necessitated to do, in regard that they

            After this happened, I fell into a very sad and desperate condition upon Saturday the 16th of August 1666, being then
                 about eight weeks gone. The violency thereof continued a long
                 time after Dr Wittie was with me. And for three days, he did not
                 expect my life, so that he was compelled to use all his art for
                 my preservation. But it pleased God, upon the use of his
                 medicines, that extremity a little abated. He, leaving me
                 in a hopeful way of recovery, only said I must not
                 expect to be restored until about the latter end of October.
            All which time, I was in continual faintings upon the renewal
                of that extremity; so that my loss of spirits and strength, et cetera,
                 was so great that it was expected I should have fallen
                 into a deep consumption, and I continued exceeding
                 feeble and weak until the Candlemas following. The chief remedy
                 which I found for restoring strength was a medicine made
                 of muscadine, which I was directed to by my noble and

                 my dear saviour, who hadst pity on me when the helps
                 of this world did fail. Then thou, O Lord, didst put thy 
                 words into my 
        [heart]
     and directed me that I should come unto
                 thee by faith, as the woman in the gospel did whom thou cured
                <span class="quote">(Matthew 9: 21).</span> Accordingly, I came unto thy <span class="quote">throne of grace</span>,
                 <span class="quote">desiring to lay hold on thee by faith</span>, who in thy providence
                 caused that scripture to be read that day in my ears, as a part
                of that day's lessons, when I was in my greatest distress in a
                 bed of weakness. At that time was thy holy word like <span class="quote">oil
                     in my bones</span> to cure my infirmity and gave me hope to
                 believe that thy compassion is towards the children of men to
                 pull them out of the <span class="quote">jaws of Satan and death</span>. Lord, thou did
                 see me in my sorrows and spake comfortably to my soul, 
                 <span class="quote">Daughter be of good cheer; thy faith hath made thee whole</span> (verse 22).
            And from that very day, I did recover. O Lord, my God, how
                
                 can I sufficiently set forth the glory of thy name and praise,
                 who hast compassion upon my condition and gavest me this
                 spiritual balsam to heal my soul and body. Besides thee,
                 there is none else that can do as thou dost. I beseech thee, give
                 me a thankful and holy 
        [heart]
     to entertain thee and all thy dispensations towards me, and that this miraculous mercy withal I have
                 received from thy goodness may tie and unite my soul fast

          In my 'Book of Meditations', there is a discourse upon this deliverance
              upon those words in St Matthew 9: 21-22, Luke 17: 15-16.

            After these weaknesses seized so extremely upon my person
                 with such violency and danger to my life, I could not be insensible
                 of my daily decay and dying condition, which these frequent
                 incursions of my health might too suddenly bring to its
                period. Death, in itself, being desirable to those whose affections had cause to be weaned from the comforts and vanities
                of this life, wishing to be freed from this world's troubles and
                 to be received into the arms of everlasting rest.
            Yet, as a Christian wife and mother, was there a duty incumbent upon me to discharge with faithfulness and godliness
                 towards my dear husband and children according to each capacity;
                 so that I was obliged to be a comfort to the one and a support
                 to the other while I was continued in this world.
            Which duties, I made it my study to observe, and though I
                could not be in such a state of perfection, doing all I was
                 commanded from God; yet, through his mercy strengthening
                 me, I may affirm that I made it my endeavour to perform
                 to my utmost capacity with a good conscience towards all.
            And forasmuch as the future wellbeing of my children did
                then represent itself to my thoughts — and it had pleased God
                 in mercy to spare me until that time living to see myself
                blessed with three hopeful children, for whose souls I was the most
                concerned in their education in the true faith of Jesus Christ — 
            
    <span class="event" id="ev172-start">
             I was the more induced upon this account to accept of a 
                 proposition formerly made and begun in the year 1665, by
                 Mr Comber to my dear husband, that he would except of
                himself for my daughter, Alice Thornton, in marriage.

                Who, though her years were but young, being 14 then,
                yet such was his great affection towards her that he was
                desirous to attend for her seven years if he might by his leave
                obtain her at last (having deserted all other opportunities
                for her sake and the favours he had from him). And, also, that whatever her fortune was , it should be wholly for her to use and hers
                 withal: he did not despair but that God, who had preserved
                 him hitherto, would provide a handsome competency and to make
                 a better provision for my daughter by adding to her own.
                 This proposition was answered by a fair respect of Mr Thornton's
                side and he was encouraged to proceed.
            Nor could I be satisfied in a business of this nature, on which
                might depend the wellbeing of our family, without  serious and
                 deep consideration of all our affairs and the condition that our estate
                 was in. Which, being well known to my good brother Denton
                 more than to any in the world, I consulted and advised with
                 him all along in this transaction.
            Whose prudence and discretion was a great support to Mr Thornton
                and myself in all our business and actions. He, also having had
                 knowledge and acquaintance of this gentleman for several years,
                 might the better judge of his life and conversation, together with his
                 qualifications for the great and high calling of the ministry;
             which, in itself considered, carries along with it the most noble
                 title that man is capable of in this world and wherein the highest
                acts of piety and religion is vested: being honoured by God 
                 himself in the old and new testament above all other dignities,
                 and having the greatest opportunity of drawing near to the <span class="evquote">throne
                     of grace</span> from whence proceeds <span class="evquote">every good and perfect gift</span>,
                 showing to us mortals the way to everlasting life.
            After the consideration of all these motives as principally to be
                 regarded, I was in the next place confirmed in our resolves to
                 proceed in this business for my daughter, whom I hoped to
                 be placed near us and her friends at Stonegrave, being our own
                church, where I might have better advantage for my son,
                    Robert, and his sisters' instruction.
            Also, I perceived by this last unsettling of that estate from
                 my daughters and younger children, they were brought into an
                 uncertainty for their provision, which might fall too heavily
                 out for them and be the worse for them after my decease.

            So that, upon consideration of the whole business I have
                 mentioned, it was conceived convenient to entertain
                 this motion and to close with such a happy opportunity which
                 by the providence of God was directed. And by reason of
                 her youth, we resolved to keep it secret until a fitter time
                 when this intended business should be consummated.
                 There being still an affectionate correspondency of these
                 persons by chaste and religious conversations in our family.

                 Neither was I out of hopes that Sir Christopher Wandesford
                might duly pay his £2000 out of Ireland, which was to
                 redeem that estate and pay Mr Thornton's engagements.
            But, in the meantime, I might more probably die in some
                 of these sicknesses and my dear husband, who was often falling into his palsy, when after our decease, my children
                 would be left in an uncertain condition for assistance.
            Behold the goodness of God, which taketh care for mine, even
                 out of strangers; making me see his mercy in his providences manifold to me and mine. <span class="quote">Praise the Lord, O my soul,

            It pleased God to visit my dear brother, John Wandesford,
                 at London with his last sickness, being an ague joined
                 with violent fits of the stone. Having had several of them
                 the last half year, his sickness continued so strongly
                 that he was very weak in body, though I bless God perfect
                 in mind and spirit. I am the better able to show the same from
                 the relation of his own servant and the people where he lived
                 testifying this truth to Mr Comber, who was then at London
                 and entreated by me to visit my dear brother in his affliction.
                 At the news of hearing of me, he did much rejoice and fain
                 would have seen his dear and beloved sister but, when he
                 understood I was in Yorkshire, he prayed them to remember
                 his dear love to me and thank me for sending to see him,
                 with abundance of testimonies of his affection and love to me and
                 mine, praying for us. Then did he more zealously prepare for
                 his change and departure out of this miserable world</span> (God having given him a taste of heaven and happiness,

            having been long since weary of it, and banished from 
               the comforts of its enjoyments). <span class="event" id="ev175a-start">For several years, since
               my brother George's death, he had laid under the most
                 sad and afflicting hand of God by reason of the want of the
                 use of his understanding, which came to him by a deep
                 melancholy seizing upon his spirit (partly for the loss of
                  my said brother and the grief he took upon ill usage
                 in the detaining of his annuity). He, being of a sweet,
                 noble nature, it wrought the more to his prejudice.</span>
         
    <span class="event" id="ev175b-start">
            But, I do believe that what things of this nature (to any
                 of the prejudice of our family) did not proceed from the
                 heir's own inclination, being naturally of a good
                 and sweet disposition, but from the counsel of such by
                 whom he had been acted since his marriage (who had
                 advised my brother, George, to destroy the entails and settlements
                 of his father by which he might be free to settle his estate
                 wholly upon his daughter to the ruin of all his family).
             But my brother, George Wandesford, abhorred such treachery, nor ever
                 harkened to such designs; nor could my brother, Christopher, understand the depth of such insinuations, not being experienced in the transactions of business of this nature.</span>
            
            However it was, this poor brother was the greatest sufferer, both in body and mind; having been often recruited
                 and fully restored, was again brought down, through troubles
                 and want he sustained, nor was it in my power to help
                 or relieve him otherwise then by my prayers and tears for him
                 (our own sufferings being so great).
            Yet did the <span class="quote">God of mercies</span> give him many intervals in which
                 times he was religiously disposed and constant in duties, with
                 a conscience to spend his days holily and uprightly and in great
                 penitence for anything that might offend his God.
            
    <span class="event" id="ev176-start">
            About half a year before his death, he was more strict in
                 his severe duties of piety, saying that he should not live long
                 so that he prepared for his desolation each day.
            The morning before he departed, though he was very weak in
                 body, he would kneel in bed and most devoutly and seriously,
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.221&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 221</a>



            
                 
            
            prayed to his God and <span class="evquote">heartily recommended his soul to
                 his creator</span>, and so laid himself quietly down: he
                 drew his breath shorter each minute and, at last, <span class="evquote">sweetly fell asleep in the Lord</span>.</span> Thus was the conclusion of that dear and
                 sweet brother, so much afflicted and under so long a
                 weakness: his condition was much to be lamented and it
                 was, indeed, a continual grief and daily corrosive to myself, whose nearness in affection and consanguinity had
                 a sufficient sympathy in his sufferings.
            He was a very great loss to our family by his trouble 
                 and visitation, whose parts, piety, learning and quick wit
                 was not inferior to any that was remaining of it; being
                 of a most sweet, affable, and ingenious nature, nimble and
                 ready in his acute answers in disputes as well at 
                school as Cambridge. At both places, he carried himself
                 so obligingly that all persons of his acquaintance loved and admired in his sagacity, coming nearest to his brother George, et cetera, for wit and parts.
                <span class="event" id="ev177-start">
                 My dear mother had given him the best education she could,
                 sending him to Cambridge about 15 years old, under the
                tuition of Dr Widdrington, where he made great improvement of his time in the sciences  and learning. And was
                so studious, even at nights and when his hours should have
                 been for recreation, that his tutor was forced to forbid that severity. His Sabbaths were spent always (as much as he could)
                 very strict, in acts of religion and piety: truly from his
                 childhood and youth studying to serve and fear God.
                </span>
                 In fine, he was so hopefully good and pregnant that my mother
                had much comfort — and all his relations joy — in him, being
                 full of expectations that this early plant might flourish to
                the honour and happiness of the whole family. But it so happened, 
                 to our great grief, that <span class="event" id="ev178-start">this melancholy seizing on him first at
                 Cambridge in a great sickness. Then, he was by an infinite
                 care and cost of my mother, he was perfectly well again. But,
                 upon the former accidents mentioned, he fell very ill
                 and yet all her care was continued over him; even at London,
                where he had been enticed to go from her, contrary to her mind.
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.222&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 222</a>



            
                 
            
            And suffered great hardships and injuries for the want
                 of some care over him and negligence to perform that
                 duty until my dear mother committed him under the 
                 tuition of Dr Bathurst which he did faithfully perform all his life towards him (when he wanted nothing
                 for his comfort and help that either he  or my mother
                 could do for him). She, every year, giving that doctor a
                 gratuity of £10 for his pains and care over my brother
                so long as the doctor lived. Although even then he wanted to discharge the man's house (where he laid) out of
                his own dues and annuity.</span> But I am sorry there was
                 cause to speak thus much on this subject, shall therefore return to speak  concerning his burial.
            
    <span class="event" id="ev179-start">
                He departed this life upon the second day of December
                 1666</span> and <span class="event" id="ev180-start">buried in the parish church of Hoddesdon, with
                 as handsome a solemnity as could be in that time. Mr Comber
                 preached a funeral sermon. Text: Ecclesiastes.
                 There being abundance of people on that occasion, he
                was buried the 3rd of December. Mr Tirrill and his wife and servant,
                 all expressing very great sorrow and lamentation for him,
                 who had lived so innocently and carried himself
                 so handsomely and well, that had gained their affections and
                 pity towards his person very much in that place.
                 God making him to find favour in his distress amongst strangers.</span> And now, the Lord <span class="quote">God of mercies</span>
                 has, I hope, freed him from all misery, want and oppression.
                 His most sad afflictions for several years had
                 prepared his soul for his saviour, who had kept him
                 in all his health and sickness from any gross sins nor
                 was he inclined thereto in the least but given himself to
                 God in his youth and childhood. (He was never heard to swear
                 an oath.) Before he went to Cambridge, I heard him make
                the most fine exposition extempore upon those words of
                 David's advice to Solomon, <span class="quote">and thou, Solomon my son, know
                thou the God of thy father</span>, et cetera (the other three verses) that I never
                 heard the like from so young a person, laying down our duty
                 to God and service of him.

            I hope he now enjoys those happinesses this world is not capable
                 of, who set himself to seek God so early and so with <span class="quote">an upright 
        [heart]
    </span>. And, however that the greatest of temporal afflictions
                
                 lay heavy on him, yet God sanctified all to him and gave
                him his perfect use of his reason and understanding that half 
                 year before (wherein he so exercised himself as was a 
                great comfort to his friends and relations, and testified that he 
                gave a return to some of our faithful prayers for him).
            Therefore, in all things, it now remains that I most heartily
                 return my humble and faithful thanks, glory and praise:
                 that heard the groans of his banished, delivering him by a
                 quiet and <span class="quote">sweet sleep of death</span> from all calamities of this
                 wicked world and pressed him for himself, who wanted those
                 mercies which thousands doth enjoy. And the Lord's name be blessed forever that preserved his precious soul to his kingdom through
                 Jesus Christ. I beseech him, sanctify this, thy hand, upon my
                     brother to me that thereby I may be drawn nearer to thy
                 majesty in love and gratitude, who hast not given me over
                 into the will or power of spiritual enemies or suffered me
                 to lie in this condition wherein he was visited. Lord, make
                 me to admire thy goodness and clemency towards me (thy
                 poor handmaid) who had deserved thy heavy hand, but thou
                 are pleased with testimonies of favour when thy mercy is
                 provoked that we may further glorify thy name and set forth
                 thy honour even to all generations.
            Make me, O Lord, to esteem it thy free act of grace to me
                 that I have never been visited in the least with this kind of affliction:
                for thou alone has preserved me therefrom, which might have
                 befallen me as to many of thy dear servants in this world
                 by their other troubles of this life. O Lord, except my humble,
                thankful heart, and I beseech thee, <span class="quote">if it be thy will</span>, for
                 Christ's sake never suffer me to fall into this most sad estate
                 whereby I may be deprived of the opportunities of doing thee
                 service or good to my soul. But give me still the perfect use of
                 reason and understanding that I may live all my days to the glory 
                 of thy majesty, and the profit of my brethren and the eternal
                 good of my own soul, for the Lord's sake. Amen.

            The 5th of January, my dear Robin Thornton began his sickness

                them being very great ones and full).
            About the 14th, his fever and disease was at height, and on the
                 15th, he altered for the better, so that a change was discerned;

            After the recovery of my health and strength again,
                 I had returned another affliction which was not at that
                 time so heavy (when I was sick myself, I bless God)
                 but, like two buckets in a well it pleased God to deal with
                 us: when the one was down the other was up. So, I being
                 recruited, had my work in the assistance of my dear husband, whose often and frequent relapses into his palsy
                 fell on him to my abundant grief; so that, from November 1667 
                 until August 1668, Dr Wittie was almost each month
                 fetched to him when he relapsed or the degrees beginning on
                him. Which most sad condition made me never enjoyed myself with fears of losing him, my chiefest comfort and
                 support, and for his sufferings. Although the Lord did please
                 to give him intermissions, and also we could not perceive that 
                 he was in any extremity but slumbering all the time of
                 his illness, until after clysters he was brought

            to himself again (they being the speediest remedy at
               present). Then, afterward, all other remedies was applied by Dr Wittie's
                    
                
                
               direction and he was well again even to peoples' 
                 admiration, which was so ill of a sudden and better again.
               And, according to the earliness of beginning with remedies,
                 they wrought and the fits longer or shorter in continuance</span>;
                
                <span class="event" id="ev203-start">
                 so that we saw, too apparently, that my dear husband's distemper might be a means to shorten his days at last. And 
                 we were much concerned to get all the settlements 
               done and perfected, lest we should be deprived of him.
            And to that end, my brother Denton, with Mr Comber
                 and myself, was exceedingly employed at all times,
                 almost when he was in a condition for business:
                 hastening the drafts of writings and settlements with
                 counsel how to give all persons satisfaction in their
                just debts. And not until the 28th day of May 1668
                 was our settlement perfected (from the time of my cousin
                 Covill's being destroyed) for either portions or maintenance , which went most sadly with me. But now, by the great
                 pains and industry of my brother Denton and Mr Comber,
                who we did for my children's good employ  as a 
                 friend to them in general (as well as in his particular 
                 respect for my daughter Alice) had much care
                for them. Also, it was most true that I lived remote from my
                own relations.  That day wherein my dear husband
                 signed his deed for my children's provision out of 
                 Leysthorpe, he did sign my brother Denton's three rentcharge
                for his part of portion, by my sister of £250 out of the
                 other part of Leysthorpe, which ought in conscience to be paid.
                 I humbly bless our gracious Father which gave me leave
                 to get this done for provision of my younger children,
                 and that the estate was in a better frame than it had been of
                 late by the payment of £1000 in debts of his rentcharge
                 of Mr Sayer, which he had but newly sold (and paid off with it,
                 this year, many great engagements secured out of the
                 land at Leysthorpe) by which it was made clearer.</span></p>

            About the 20th day of May, on that night, my dear husband had a dream which he told to my brother Denton,
                 Mr Comber and myself, in the morning severally, which
                did very much trouble me to hear, that he should
                 live but 47 days longer.</span> Nor was he ever apt to
                 take notice of such things, but rather condemn me
                 for relating several ominous dreams that I had before
                 the death of my father, my uncle Osborne, my sister
                     Danby, <span class="event" id="evn7-start">my brother George (before whose death, half a
                 year, I dreamt so fully concerning it, the manner and all
                circumstances about it that he refrained that river after 
                I told him my dream, until that time which was the last 
                 being compelled by his business to do it);</span>
             also, before my mother's death and several of my children's. So that now he himself was more apt to
                 make use of this as a warning to him, being often
                 heard to say he should not live very long, and with much
                 diligence endeavoured to prepare his soul for God.
                 In which time, I, who had my comforts so entirely bound up in him , could not with patience almost to think
                 of this change, if possibly it might be the good pleasure
                 of the Lord to spare him to us.
           
    <span class="event" id="ev205-start"> 
               We repaired, upon the next illness, to Dr Wittie (he not
                 being willing for any others advice), to confided what
                 course could be taken for his preservation; so that, upon
               a serious consideration of his distemper then inclining
                to melancholic, he advised him for the spa, where he
                 had been other years with good success. Upon which, Mr Thornton
                 was very desirous to go, believing it would help him,
                 and the doctor firmly engaged to be as careful of him
               as his own life. So, upon the 5th of June 1667, we
                set forward in a coach with him to Malton, with my three
                    children, I thinking to have gone to Scarborough with him,
                 but it so pleased God that I fell exceeding ill that I could
                 not go but was forced to return home to Newton. And
                 left him under the care of my brother Portington and sister,

            and in the company of Dr Wittie. The 8th of June following, he went
                 by a hired coach to Scarborough and about a month after
                 he returned home on horseback (it being his own desire).
            All which time, we had a dear and comfortable correspondency
                between us by our mutual and frequent letters. I, hearing
                 of him, or from him, three times in a week and ofter,
                 each one bringing me the good news of his having cast off his melancholy.
                 It cannot be imagined what my joy was in his return
                 to find him so prettily recruited by a cheerful temper
                 of spirit but I quickly saw that his weakness had left
                 much dregs of his distemper. Yet had I great cause
                 of thankfulness to the Lord which gave me hopes of him
                 and that, if he could have been prevented of cold, he would remain

            Upon the complaint of Mrs Danby to Mrs Batt (then a
                 servant to the young Countess of Sussex and accounts
                 by her to be the dearest friend she had in the world) of her
               hard usage by Madam Danby and several discontents
                framed by her servant in my house, adding to her former disgust towards me in her being cast out, as she
                 said, for my sake. These, with other secret unjust reasons
                of her own, by these two persons was a mutual compliance
               in their designs, and Mrs Danby's undermining me in secret
                 brought Mrs Batt late at night to my house at Newton
                 (under pretence of providing butter for Mrs Danby at the
                service at Howley to wait on that mad Countess of Sussex).
                 Mrs Batt told me she came to fetch her cousin Danby away  and that she would have her from me. I, upon this first
                 salutation, being surprised with her discourse (as well as her
                 sudden visit, which yet Mrs Danby knew of) told her
                 again that I had been desirous to see her and of her acquaintance
                 upon my niece her account, but that she should now come
                 to fetch her from me, whose welfare I much wished and
                 loved her company, without giving me any notice, I could
                 not tell what to say of it. And that what my poor house could
               afford towards my niece, her content, and what I could do
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.236&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 236</a>



            
                 
            
            for her should not be a wanting, no more than what
                 I had formerly done to my weak capacity. And I could
                 not willingly part with her, hoping that her sister (upon
                 my soliciting) would settle her again.
            My discourse more to this purpose, but the other said she
                 would have her away from me. Then, I returned that I
                 would leave it to my niece herself to determine as she
                 pleased. Upon the Sunday morning, they having lain
                together that night and prepared for a march to Howley, but
                 they were prevailed to stay that day, being every way
                unfit to break the Sabbath upon so slight an occasion.</span><span class="event" id="ev206a-start"> 
            
            Upon discourse with Mrs Batt, she said that she admired
               why all Mrs Danby's friends that none of them could endure
               her of her husband's side, but I, that looked at her or showed any
                 respect. I said that I could not so well know the reason,
                 save that she brought no fortune and was a charge to that family,
                 as I had heard them say, and that Sir Thomas Danby could not be
                 reconciled because of Kit's marriage to her against his
                 knowledge or consent. Then, Mrs Batt said, it was true
                 that she had seen a letter in Virginia that came to Mrs Danby
                from Sir Thomas out of England, in answer to one from Mrs Danby
                 to him, that was extremely sharp: where he told her that
                she had inveigled his son to marry her without his consent
                and their marriage was not lawful, and for her (that had not
                 a groat portion after such an act) to be so proud and high
                 as to require him to furnish her with silk stockings, satin
                 and cloth,  silver mantles and other things answerable to that
                 state, was more presumption than any could imagine
                (his son being a younger brother, and so had nothing but from
                 his goodness). Sir Thomas Danby expressing much more to her in
                that letter to this purpose and was so incensed that he would
                
                
                seldom
                
                see her in all his life, but shunned her at all times,
               sending for his son into England without her. I said, I had
                 not heard of such letters, but that Sir Thomas was much displeased
                 at me and my mother for speaking for her to him. And said that 
                 we knew her not so well as he did, and that they might curse
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.237&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 237</a>



            
                 
            
            time of her entrance into his family for the mischief she
                 had wrought in it, and that match could not prosper which was
                 begun in such an unlawful manner; it had been the grand
                 discontent of his life and more to the like purpose several
                 times, so, my mother nor myself, after many endeavours,
                 could never prevail for her. Yet did I always commiserate her condition, whose person was so qualified and 
                 seemed to be religious and carried so fair in her demeanour,
                 having abundance of charity for her condition, having
                 helped her with advice and assistance in all things to my
                 power, believing that she had been wronged according to her
                 own complaint.</span><span class="event" id="ev206b-start">
                When our discourse was ended, they 
                 came from church and went to dinner. After, it was consulted
                 on and thought fit to send to Mr Farrer, at Malton, for his
                 advice whether Mrs Danby might go to Howley as a visit.
                 Who returned by word that he conceived she might go 
                
                
                thither,
                
                 although he knew that place was in opposition to Madam Danby
                 and would displease her if she stayed any time, but for a while
                 she might go, as he thought, without prejudice. This she 
               conceived was allowance, but he spoke very prudently 
                 to both parties. Then, Mrs Danby was pleased (as it were)
                 to consult, as she said (at least in pretence) with me of her 
                 going thither. Which I could not tell how to determine because,
                at that time, her sister Danby was coming into the country and
                 I was to use my endeavours for her, having then very
               good hopes, as also, so had Mr Farrer, who said he did
                 believe he could prevail for £60 a year if she would except
                 it. And withal, I did not know what to advise which might
               satisfy her but left it to her how to dispose herself; for
                I told her that, as well as I could entertain her in my house,
                 she should want for nothing. I would use my utmost with
                 her sister to give a sufficient provision for her and her children
                 but doubted that her journey to Howley might do harm.
               But because I could not do her what good I would, being so
                 low in our estate, I could not hinder from her better advantage. She said, indeed, it was much below her to go to
                service as Mrs Batt did counsel her, and she thanked God,

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.238&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 238</a>



            
                
            
            if she would take that course of life, she could do better
                 for herself. But she would go over to see the place because
                 it was out of Mattie Batt's love, extolling her friendship
                 to the skies and much undervaluing all my endeavours and
                 faithfulness; yet, did she expect this as a reserve if
                 she liked not Howley. The next morning prepared with great
                 joy to go and, when she was at breakfast, expressed much
                 indignation that she was turned out (as she termed it) for my
                sake from Bedale. I could answer no otherwise than to
                show my sorrow for it, and that if she had informed me of that
                 before that her sister was angry, she should not have come.
            At her going that morning, she was highly displeased (as
                 I was informed that she spoke it to) that Mr Comber or my 
                 brother Denton, who she had much deluded with fair show,
                 did not wait upon her to Howley, and was only conducted by my chief servant and three of the Earl's men, with Mrs
                 Batt and her maid.</span><span class="event" id="ev206c-start">
            
            This was only a pretence, though pride enough; for when
                 I sent men and horses to bring her home — above 60 miles
                hence on purpose — she was not pleased because Mr Comber
                 came not. But sent them back empty, save with a letter to
                 my brother Denton to invite him (under pretence) but really the other, who she then prosecuted, with eager design,
                 for to draw him in for a husband for Mrs Batt. And in
                 whose encomium, she had spent so much time and pains
                to represent him with the best of rhetoric to her, which at the
                 first view, was sufficiently forward to show her good opinion of that man. Mr Thornton was highly displeased
                 that she had been so uncivil to return his servant empty, and
                 that also he was made so welcome there that he differed not from
                 a beast in his drunkenness at that house; so that he would not
                let me send no more for her.</span><span class="event" id="ev206d-start">
            
            In this time, I was so far from giving her any abuse
                 or remembering these injuries that, Madam Danby coming to see
                me on May Day, I so much solicited for her that she did
                 faithfully engage to me that for my sake, and not her own which
                 had personally disobliged her at Bedale

            before she came to Newton. Yet, she would do what she
                 could and that she would give her £60 per annum and give her £10
                 or £5 when she came to see her at a time, and give her all her goods again,
                and if she could do more, she would as she was able, et cetera.
                 And did protest and vow that she did not take it ill that
                her sister came to me, but wished her to come and that it was
                 but her plot to object that to me, to insinuate with me and to 
                 make me keep her; for she knew not that she was with me when
                she discharged her house, but that her own insufferable pride,
                 which would never be humbled, and her railing black-mouthed
                 wench that came to Farnley and abused her there, these all
                 did cause her to cast her out, and much to this purpose.
            And that she was going to look into her estate, being the first
                time after her husband's death, and as she found she could do for
                 her she would, though she did it out of her own estate for
                 my cause to bring them together although they wanted for
                 nothing now. Upon these terms passed Madam Danby and myself, concluding that I was to wait on her at Malton at her 
                 return when she would satisfy me better and do for her. 
            Having received this handsome and free account from Madam
                 Danby, I deferred not to give Kit's wife the relation of it
                 by letter to Howley, purposely sending one before our last men
                 went for her. And her return for this kindness, I have 
                 related.</span><span class="event" id="ev206e-start">
            
            But afterwards, my brother Denton (going to see his friends
                 near Leeds) brought her back again to Newton, where I did
                 receive her with joy as was my custom out of my unfeigned
                 love to her person, nor could I be persuaded of her unworthiness to me. She so finely acting her part and so secretly, only I
                 observed abundance of height and majesty in her deportment,
                 with a kind of scorn, at her return rather more than usual
                 towards me. And did see that then I was made use of as upon
                necessity, not affection as was formerly much pretended.
            My endeavours was much slighted and daintily overseen,
                 and she highly incensed that she had not been waited upon by
                 Mr Comber, which she looked upon it as if he slighted her
                favour and rejected her friend by not accepting that motion,</span><a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.240&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 240</a>



            
                
            
            which unpardonable offence could not be passed without 
                 great indignation. Yet, so secret and subtle was this acted
       that it could not be discerned until after the malice broke out
                 publicly against me and my child, Alice Thornton.
            
            
                <span class="event" id="evn8-start">
            Let this practice of hers be examined: whether she carried
                 herself to me, either as a Christian, a friend or a well-wisher,
                 who publicly
                made me believe — nay, recommended — this
                 match to me as (in her own judgement and choice) we would
                 be exceeding happy in it; for she did find Mr Comber to be a
                 man of as great piety and parts incomparable as she never
                 knew in all her life, and that she had solicited for him, advising
                 both parties (that is to say Mr Comber and my daughter) to this
                business, above three years ago. She knew also their affections  and the progress of all that concern, and with a full gale of
                 consent, she went along with it as well, with my brother Denton
                 as ourselves.</span> <span class="event" id="ev207-start">All
                 which proves it an undoubted act of displeasure conceived
          against me and an act of revenge; thus, seeking to withdraw
                 this man's intentions from the long-intended match and that really
                 she had excellent, good opinions of this gentleman to draw
                 him to her bosom friend, whom she so loved and would prefer.
                 And I know not how it can be distinguished from a treacherous and unworthy part in a friend thus to deal with me,
                 after so long and serious debate of his intended marriage
                 with my daughter, with her own counsel, advice and approbation.
                 And so falsely to undermine the same for her own partial
                 and secret designs: first, to have offered herself to bring a 
                 match about with Mrs Katherine Farrer (which she told him
                 would be of great advantage to him) and then, when that failed
                 and he would not close with her — against his full intentions 
                and our resolutions already long since agreed upon —
             but this did not satisfy her, until she had made a new trial
                 and assault upon his loyalty by the last expedition

                related of Mrs Batt. In all which time, since her last coming to
                 Newton, ever endeavouring to withdraw by insinuations and 
                 excellent plausibility Mr Comber's affections from my daughter,
                 after her evil designs was hatched against us at Newton.
                 These are full proof of her great admiration of this man 
                 with 100 more tricks: telling him that she had so great an 
                 honour for him that he deserved a better fortune and wife than
                 she was, for there was like to be nothing worthy of his
                parts and deservings, and that he would be undone and never live
                 comfortable life. And she wished him so well that she could
                 desire him the best wife in the world, ever admiring his perfections
                 and insinuated so much that she got his sermon notes or heads,
                 and then write them over and called them her own (so did she with
                him about his coats of heraldry of the nobility of England),
             ever seeking opportunities when to use artifices to her own
                 purpose of insinuation, which can be testified for truth to
                 ingratiate into his affection, none endeavouring to admire
                 his person and all expressions imaginable than herself. 
            At the same time, though at secret opportunities, she would
                 come to my daughter, Alice, telling her that she wished her
                 so well, and loved her for her good nature and virtue, that she
                 would have her marry the best husband in the world and that she
                 deserved it. And that, if those things were true that Mr Comber was
                 charged with, he was not worthy to live and God forbid she should
                have him, with abundance of such insinuations to this purpose.
                 Nally told her, she thanked her for her love, but she was
                 bound not to believe evil of any unless she should see it,
                 and that she had never known any unhandsomeness from him
                in all her life. It was true she had an affection for him, for
                she see no other cause, for she had received much good
                 from him for her soul, and she would have done well to have
                showed her dislike before. And to that purpose, thanking her for
                 propounding one of her own relations to her; for she was 
                not worthy of such a person of honour; and that she hoped to God
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.242&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 242</a>



            
                 
            
            he would direct her in her choice, when she did marry,
                 that she might lead a comfortable life in the fear of God
                though not so high in the world, et cetera. And she could
                 never believe any such ill of Mr Comber, as those said
                 which told her, for she knew his conversation to the contrary.
            Upon which discourse, Mrs Danby did no more insist upon
                 anymore to her but grew to hate her more, notwithstanding all my daughter's observance and attendance
                 on her</span> 
                <span class="event" id="ev207a-start">
                after her return from Howley and Madam Danby's
                 to Malton. I endeavoured with Mr Thornton to get her company thither  that I might have reconciled her and her sister,
                 but she could not be prevailed with upon no terms, nor
                 so much as to write to her in a civil way. But said, 
                 several times, she had as leve see the devil as her.
            So that I went only with my brother Denton thither, and
                had a most tedious and ill journey, being  sick as well
                 when I came there, as back again, as I had like to have
                 died. Upon my address to Madam Danby, I found her very
                 civil to me but so highly incensed against Kit's wife as
                 I did admire. And, at first, would not scarce hear me
                 speak for her at all: saying that since she saw me last,
                 she had been informed of her perfidious railing and dishonour
                 in all things, making her guilty as much as her lying
                 tongue and godly railing could do of the horriblest sins of the
                 world, and she would do nothing because of her wicked malice.
            And that, for all what I did for her, she was unworthy of it
                 because she had railed on me too for a requital.
                 But, I said, I could not believe any such thing of her who
                had so much religion, et cetera, and I thought her wronged,
                begging that she would not believe anythingany thing against her
                 from evil instruments that sowed discord betwixt them.
                 And at the last, with much ado, endeavoured to
                 prevail that she would, for my
                 sake, give them a sufficient provision and settle £80 per annum
                 on her and her children. She said that, if she would except
                 £60 a year, which was all that she could do, they should
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.243&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 243</a>



            
                 
            
            have it done; and that she would get Kit a place in a troop
                 and give them their furniture and fit him with accoutrements 
                 of all things for it; and, if she see them endeavour to live,
                 she would give her £10 or £5 at a time for encouragement
                 when she came to see her. But I, having no commission
                 to accept of £60 per annum from my niece Danby but a charge
                 to the contrary, could not promise for her; only pressed for
                 £80, leaving her to consider of it because £60 would not
                 pay their debts, and I would acquaint Mrs Danby with
                 her proposals and would give her an account. 
            To that end
                 I did, at my return to Newton, give her as favourable an
                 account of my embassy as I could, concealing
                 all speeches which should give her the least cause of trouble.
            But Mrs Danby was not inclinable to accept of her sister's
                 offers, but stood upon her high horse. She would either
                 have £80 a year settled upon her and her debts promised
                 to be paid, or she would never enslave herself again to live 
                as she had done with her children. She could tell how to live
                 otherwise, if she might not live handsomely with them.
            After a day's time or two, it was thought fit I should 
                 write to Madam Danby again to second my solicitation for
                 her. And a letter was contrived by consent, wherein I writ
                 with as much humble submission as a petitioner for another
                 could dictate, only some clauses was put in from Mrs
                 Danby's own mouth (wherein she said she could not subsist
                under £80 a year, and if it were until seven years and their debts
                 paid).  Madam Danby returned me a most sharp and bitter
                 answer: that since I was so positive for Kit's wife, and that she
                 would not except of her free offers by me, which she was not
                 obliged to otherwise than by her good will, she would never
                 give her anything at all; and that she had made her brags
                 she had better friends than her husband's and could provide
                 for herself, she might; and that she would take care of her husband  and the children she had, to bring them up and provide

            for them and him, but would never have anything to
                do for her, with several such like expressions, so much
                 was she disobliged for her high demands. And upon this
                 account did she cast her off, nor would have nothing
                to do with her further, and was so much displeased at
                 me that I, then, quite lost her favour. Neither could I see
                 any requital in the other but a slighting for my faithfulness and goodwill. Yet still, I shall not fail of my
                duty of charity to pray for those in necessity and forgiveness that hates me without a cause. </span>

                 to show my great commiseration and charity, affection and
                 love I had towards this gentlewoman, which not only was
                 showed to her as my bosom friend — in whose friendship
                 I rejoiced and thought myself happy in being instrumental to do any thing serviceable to her in faithfulness and
                 affection, as well in testimonies of gratitude for what
                kindness I received in my former sicknesses and two children —
                 as also of her low estate; being come into my sister's family,
                 there was nothing awanting in my family or myself

                 that knew my actions and would speak nothing but truth)

                 of from that league of amity and friendship which was of a long
                time (even after six years acquaintance) contracted with her.
                 I may now see my folly, when it is too late to bewail my
                 misery, not to foresee that possibly to be true which I could

            to be their bitterest adversaries and repine at their
                 happiness, when themselves are miserable or unfortunate.
                 Some of this gentlewoman's
                    
                 sinister endeavours has been declared
                 by me, with their proof being very evident: endeavouring to have
                 gotten subsistence more to her satisfaction under their
                 roofs, when she should have brought that match to perfection,
                being that which was conjectured by her eager designs.
                 Having wholly cast off those former friendships which she
                 pretended for me, I need not examine the injustice or wrong
                 done in this action, but should have waived anything (as
                 I did of this nature) had it rested there and not proceeded to
                 such high indignities against my person and the family
                from whence I descended: persons of honour, virtue and worth,
                 whose ashes long since was buried in the unspotted bed of

                 not raise a false report</span>, nor <span class="quote">speak evil of no man</span>,
                much less to join with the wicked and scorners against
                 their own knowledge and experience of them that fears
                God, lest they bring on themselves that punishment spoke
                of in Psalms 1:4-6, Proverbs 24: 8: <span class="quote">He that deviseth
                    to do evil shall be called a mischievous person</span>. Proverbs 24:28
                 <span class="quote">Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause:
                 and deceive not with thy lips</span>. Too sadly have I experienced
                this, Proverbs 25:18-19: <span class="quote">confidence in an unfaithful man in
                time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a  foot out
                 of joint</span>. <span class="quote">A man that beareth false witness against his
                 neighbour is a maul, and a sword and a sharp arrow</span>.
            Yet, such has been my hard, miserable fortune to meet withal
                 in this time of my life, when the other heavy afflictions and trials
                 from God lay upon myself, dear husband and children,
                 I must taste of this bitter pill too <span class="quote">as one ingredient of the
                 mixture of my saviour's cup</span>, which I will endeavour to

                learning the counsel of the wise man in Ecclesiasticus 37:1-3,
                 where he describes the property of a false friend, <span class="quote">saying

                 Had the profession of religion in these parties been real,

                the hearing and concealing my wrongs in her own bosom.
                  And not only so but made it her business of examination , amongst the servants of the house, how to screw out
                 any circumstantial passages (were they never so 
                 harmless and innocent in themselves) that the instruments of the devil wickedly perverted not to their own advantage. And corrupt hearts
                charged with malice and hypocrisy, who being evil 
                 themselves and reproved by me for their immodest carriage, had set their inventions on work how to abuse
                 my innocency in others' opinions, when their own consciences could not but bear witness against themselves
                 of my chaste and virtuous behaviour in my life and conversation

            amongst them. Nor can it be imaginable that one whose
                 heart God had framed so tender, even as I may say
                 and I hope (without boasting) like <span class="quote">Josiah's</span> sanctified from
                 his youth, accustomed with the fear of the Lord, and trained
                 up in the school of a crucified saviour with abundance
                 of afflictions and trials; being fearful of the least sin,
                 either in children or servants, or indeed any that might
                 endanger the soul of all people under my care or
                 roof. That I say, such a heart should be abandoned by
                 God, or prone of itself to do anything unseemly, the
                 laws of morality or divinity is very strange. Nay, I must with all humility acknowledge the gift and grace from God, and with
                 an unfeigned gratitude to his majesty, who hath made
                 me even from my youth to abhor not only the acts of 
                 these natures but all inclinations, tendencies, or compliances which might defile the body or pollute that precious soul
                 redeemed at so dear a rate, as by the blood of the eternal
                son of God who hath commanded us: <span class="quote">be ye holy, as I am
                 holy</span>, <span class="quote">possessing our vessels in holiness and righteousness</span>
                 forever. And must declare that it has been my daily study
                 and endeavours to aim at that perfection which is commanded
                 us: <span class="quote">be ye perfect, as my heavenly Father is perfect</span>. Not
                 that I dare to imagine it is possible to attain that full perfection in this life , so weak and frail; yet, I follow after, if that 
                 I may possibly obtain that for which I am apprehended of Christ
                 Jesus, although I daily cast myself down at the footstool (in the true sense of my own unworthiness) of Christ
                 Jesus, acknowledging with St Paul, <span class="quote">though I know nothing by
                 myself yet am I not thereby justified</span>. <span class="quote">And when I have
                done all I can, I am but an unprofitable servant</span>.
            Neither would I have presumed to have spoke so much upon this subject, were I not compelled to set forth God's glory
                 in my preservation and innocency in the vindication of my
                 life from all malicious imputations cast upon me. And
                 I know that St Paul, <span class="quote">when he was despised, spoke more of himself
                 than otherwise he would have done</span>. And I hope to leave these
                 lines as a justification of my innocency and integrity
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.248&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 248</a>



            
                 
            
            for the instruction of my dear children; for whose sakes,
                 I may say these sufferings has in part befallen me
                 by my great care and sedulity how to establish for their
                 future subsistence, education in the true faith and preservation from ruin (which fears too much lead me to doubt
                since all our estate was settled for debts, et cetera).
            Nor was Mrs Danby ignorant of the causes of all my sorrows, I having imparted to her the knowledge of our concerns.
                 Had her charity been as much towards the preservation of
                my honour, untouched in its root and branches, as mine was
                 to relieve herself under my roof by all imaginable
                kindnesses and respects — and to have declared what she
                had heard to myself, whose ears was ever ready to hear
                 her discourse, instead of telling her stories or rather
                forgeries) of her maid and others to my brother Denton —
                 I had not been so irreparably abused but have found
                 out a way to have righted myself long before I came to
                 the knowledge of being wronged.
            But, yet even this particular passage of revealing those
                lies to my brother, we had too much cause to think them to have been done
                 out of policy against me and insinuation to him. It did, by
                 the mercy of God, prove a greater argument of my wrong
                 and abuses to him, who had been a daily witness of my
                 carriage for many years together. And those many things, which
                 I was charged with as crimes, he himself had been made known
                 to in every respect and justified such actions against
                my accusers: he being extremely grieved for my sufferings  and a faithful friend in my adversity.
            Having been privy to all transactions of our private concerns and writings, which was not fit to publish to strangers
                 or servants. And yet the nature of envy is such to make
                that evil which they cannot understand, and surely these
                 people envied me, either a being in this world or the grace
                 of God in my actions, who maliciously invented prodigious lies and fomented them under the pretext of an
                honour for my person?
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.249&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 249</a>



            
                
         
    <span class="event" id="ev208-start"> 
            Neither could I be informed of such slanders against
                 me until by Mrs Danby's maid's taking an occasion to fall
             out with me about the dressing the chamber, when it was very
                 foul. She, being in that woman's place (which they pretended
                 had first raised those lies) and desiring to have been in my
                 own maid's place, sought an occasion to undermine her
                 of that place or else to give me warning to provide for one
                 in hers, having a desire to be at liberty (which I was not unwilling to in regard of myself but because I kept her with
                 me until my niece Danby was resettled in her own house, and
             then she was to go with her and to have done Mrs Danby a
                 kindness in it). But, on the contrary, it proved an unfortunate act by reason of their disgusts both of the mistress and
                 servant against myself and family. Yet, it was the occasion that brought these mysteries of forgeries to my knowledge:
                 the maid telling me that she could tell me who had abused
                 and wronged me in my family, but not unless she went away for making a mischief, as she called it.
            Upon which words, I told her that I should have been beholden to 
                her if she knew I was wronged and to let me know by whom. 
                But she said, no, not unless she went away. I said, it was 
                 very hard if I could not be informed of the injury was done without
                 she went away and I would be determined by her mistress.
                So, finding her mistress in the same humour — having agreed together that I should not be righted by them unless she went away  — it troubled me much to see such dealing. As also that I
                was abused, as was pretended by others, when as she, which
                 was my friend,  had concealed the matter to make her
                 own advantage against me. Nor should I have been told
                anything to have righted myself at all, if her maid's
                 quarrelling unjustly had not produced this effect.
            What was the cause of these proceedings, God knows; for I
                 had not given either of them just occasion, whom I had treated
                 like sisters in my house. But it was discernible that some
                 sinister end was at the bottom, and <span class="evquote">not out of love to the truth</span>
                 or me that things was thus ordered.

            When I perceived myself thus used — rather than I
                 could endure to lie under wrongs and of what nature I
                knew not, nor how to come to understand them — I told them
                 that Barbara might do as she pleased. If she did not like
                 my service, she was free to please herself, though I could
                 been glad she would stay while her mistress stayed. Upon this
                she was resolved to go away, but I earnestly desired
                 her mistress would give her leave to tell me how I was abused , and by whom, that I might not still continue so. And I
                 should have been obliged to her if she would have told me
                 of it herself upon the account of friendship.
            But Mrs Danby carried so infinitely high and strangely,
                 because her maid was to go from her that I got nothing
                 but scorns upon my entreaties which much amazed me.
                 Although she gave me positive warning to provide, telling
                 me she would not stay any longer. To what height then was
                 these persons come? Who did not stick to affirm I turned
                her off and not she me, which I have witness of, but to lay it on me.
                 Monday, the 20th of July, was the day appointed, upon my
                 entreaty, to be informed by them of my wrongs; which indeed
                 had near have been my last in this life, falling out of
                 my perfect health into a very dangerous sickness on
                 the occasion of sudden and violent grief and terror, which
                 I was seized upon in Mrs Danby's chamber at Newton
                 being most strangely surprised at Barbara's accusation,
                 before my face, of my servant Hannah Ableson for telling
                 her several stories from another servant (very great
                 lies and falsehoods against myself) of such a nature as
                 I did abhor. And much unbecoming any to hear and not to
                 have acquainted me with at first, that I might have brought
                 that person to condign punishment (as Mr Thornton would
                 have done if it had been from her it was laid on). But it
                 was doubted to be of new invention to have outed this
                 maid of my favour who, when she heard those horrid 
                 things, did utterly deny them all and cleared herself on
                 oath that she never knew nor heard anything from me

            in all her life but what was good, chaste and virtuous, and
                 that she might as well take away her life by <span class="evquote">false witness</span>
                 as wrong both me and her. But Barbara carried her spleen
                 on so unhandsomely, with such loud clamours against me and
                 her, unchristianly aggravating, accusing and laughing in
                scorn against my person and the honour of my family.
            Namely, in these words, <span class="evquote">like the old accuser of the brethren</span>
                that I was nought — my mother, my sister and all I came on —
                 and this so imprudently before her mistress that I bust
                 out into an excessive, lamentable sorrow and weeping, with
                 such exceeding violence, not being able to contain nor
                answer much, saving that I could rather a thousand times have
                 lost my life than to be robbed of those inestimable jewels
                as the honour of my dear and blessed parents and friends. And
                 that <span class="evquote">I hoped God would judge my cause</span> and theirs against all
                 these slanders of the devil's inventions, and it like to have
                 cost my life then, had I not had comfort in God and the testimony
                 of my own conscience to bear me witness of mine and
                 their innocencies. And I was so highly concerned to hear
                 those holy persons' graves defiled by unjust calumnies, which
                 had they been nipped in the bud there might have been redemption
                 from the first raisers.</span> <span class="event" id="evn9-start">But now they had done me the most
                 highest act of malice to conceal these lies which they laid
                 upon one Mary Breakes, which was gone to Richmond. And they
                 requited me thus, by their abominable abusing my charity
                 in relieving her under my roof, making themselves
                 instruments in my persecution under pretence of the accusing my maid, Hannah, which yet was endeavoured to be drawn
                 into the plots against me.</span> But, these highest aggravations of
                 miseries, done by my own bosom friend, is more treacherous
                 and ungrateful than I can express, and had almost broke
                 my heart to be thus dealt with by her that knew my innocency
                 (which shows she had a mind to revenge some pique against
                 us to hear her husband's family thus abused, and sat as
                 a judge to condemn but not rightly to determine).

                 them both down which had so basely injured and
                 abused myself and family. But I begged and entreated
                 him that he would not do it, for my niece had no place
                 of being. But he was resolved to have her out that had
                 carried so ungratefully towards me, which had been a mother
                 to her at all times. </span><span class="event" id="ev208b-start">Nay, she carried so highly base that,

                 others against me) that they both laughed and jeered,
                
                 and rejoiced together that they had revenged themselves on
                me. And when Nally told Barbara, it was not a business
                 to laugh at, basely said again: what cared she, it
                deserved nought but laughing at, with other opprobrious,
                 scoffing languages which caused abundance of grief in
                my poor, innocent child who was persecuted by these
                 people as well as the mother. 
            
            And all this was done because they failed of their unjust
                 designs, that nought else would satisfy but a revenge
                 that might remain to all posterity to blaspheme the honour
                 and good fame of those which (they both did avouch even in 
                 their madness) they could not charge us with anything.
                Upon my charging of Mrs Danby,  at that time, and her maid
                 to show what she had seen or known of me of that nature,
                 they solemnly cleared us themselves never to have seen 
                 or heard any thing themselves, but laid those lies on
                 others. It was then more sin and shame for them to wrong
                me in that, and either to believe or keep it in their breasts
                 contrary to their own knowledge, and now to be executioners, after seven- or eight-months concealment, of others' deaths.</span>
            
            And under a pretence (which was hardly gained to) instead
                 of healing those wounds of others, they rejoiced to have
                 such a <span class="quote">poisoned arrow</span> to wound my afflicted, despised
                 soul with, which Mrs Danby knew so innocent and tender in that
                 (it was worse than death). And then to rejoice at my deplorable

            condition, which I was brought into thereby in their abominable
                 behaviour against me, which yet deserved the courtesy of a Christian;
                 nay, of poor prisoner, not to be accused, condemned and executed before a just and legal hearing. And that by such who
                 could not charge me with the guilt of such accusations.
                 If heaven dealt no better with the most righteous upon the
                 earth, there would be none saved at that great day. But
                 we know <span class="quote">that judge determines just judgement</span>, <span class="quote">without
                 partiality, without hypocrisy</span>, envy or malice, all which are
                 the badges of the <span class="quote">father of lies</span>. Who, if we here set ourselves to fight under Christ's banner, bidding him defiance,
                 not be subject to his temptations and wickedness, will surely
                 raise a mist to interrupt our peace and hinder our progress
                 to heaven which, if he prevail in, he has done his work and
                 we are ruined. But, if the <span class="quote">old serpent</span> cannot prevail, yet
                 there shall not be left one stone unturned to make us miserable. Nevertheless, though, my enemies desires was,
                 and their secret intents might endeavour to that end.
             <span class="quote">Yet, he that is the keeper of Israel and neither slumbers, nor
                 sleeps</span>, which saw the inward motions and thoughts of my
                 heart, knew my life free from and innocent of any such
                evils. But on the contrary what sorrows of 
                
        [heart]
     I sustained
                 many ways for the good and relief of my husband and children,
             the establishment of his word and gospel with other honest,
                 virtuous and laudable designs, begged of him to be fulfilled in his due time that I might end my bones in peace,
                 having taken care for those I ought in duty. He did, I
                 say, please to let me find favour in my dear husband's
                sight, who knew my designs, and all other good peoples;
                 so that I hope God will preserve his servants from that sin of
                 false accusing, judging or believing any of these things
                 against me. <span class="event" id="ev208d-start">But I was wonderfully cleared from all such
                 wrongs by all my servants in my family.
            
            For it was my desire that my brother Denton would call
                 them before him, examining each of them particularly what
                 they could say of my actions at any time, charging them
                 to speak the truth. Upon which action, they did every one
                 of them, declare upon their oaths that they never

            in all their lives saw, nor heard anything from me
                 but what tended to the good of their souls. And that if they
                should say any bad of me, they should dishonour God,
                 and wrong me and pull a curse on themselves (knowing 
                 nothing of me but civil and honest) and that they were not 
                 worthy to live that spoke otherwise of me, saying more to this 
                 purpose. And they were all grieved to see me in that
                 lamentable condition for those lies against me, and did
                 desire that I would not believe any ill of them; for they
                 had never said such things, nor ever would while they lived,
                 nor had they ever seen any uncivil action or word from
                Mr Comber in their lives but blessed God for his ministry.
                 After which examination, it was observed that Mrs Danby's
                 intentions was not to have my innocency cleared so much as to have her maid's words justified in her accusation. But my gracious God dealt more mercifully with me
                 in proving me of all the servants, which durst not avouch
                 so abominable falsehoods.</span>
            
            
            But let all be rightly determined: whether it was not
                 of pure revenge, after the march to Howley and her losing
                her expectations of this man, that should harbour so
                 damnable a plot against our innocent lives in this way
                 to be even with him and me (whom because he could not be
                 withdrawn from my daughter in marriage, and which she knew
                 was then in agitation as well as my brother Denton) thus to
                requite us both and with one sling to kill two birds:
                 by that to make the world believe what a bad person I was
                 to marry my child to such an one if it had been true.
                 And yet surely, for all her side blows in the fomenting of
                 those lies purposely to mischief me, yet she confessed she
                 had heard them long before she went to Howley. Then could
                she not possibly believe them because she had such strong
                endeavours to have this gentleman married to her chief
                
                 and excellent friend, whom she strongly wooed him for,
                which was an undeniable argument that both  our injuries
                 and wrongs were grounded upon some other grounds than
                 truth. And will, I hope, at last produce a better effect

            in her, even of repentance for all my grand indignities
                 done against me upon all accounts. Although that can be
                 little satisfaction as to the reparation of my honour 
                 and good
                 name (thus injuriously blasted by her and other instruments)
                 as also the dishonour done to God in the abusing  of his minister,
                whose person she has so justified and admired ever 
                 since she knew him, and recommended him but lately before
                 for her cousin as a most virtuous person.
            And full well she knew my care for the disposal of my child
                 to such, when I did often tell her that I would marry my
                 children to their graves before I would do it to any man
                 and was given to vicious humours. And chose this man in confidence of being free from such.
                <span class="event" id="ev208e-start">
            
               And now I am to take notice of the grand mercies of my
                 God that would not let me perish through the evil imagination
                 of those that rose up against me, but after an immeasurable 
                portion of sorrow and grief (having kept my bed 14 days, weak
                 and feeble through the exceeding pains of the mother and spleen
                 and other sicknesses thereon) yet at length he raised me 
                 up again, giving me a great comfort in my dear aunt
                 Norton's company, who, hearing of my sad misfortune and
                weakness, came to put a stop to my troubles. 
                </span>
                The Lord God,
                 seeing my intentions cordially good, would not suffer me
                 to fall but gave me relief in his providence, and by the satisfaction received in my good friends had an opportunity
                to give a full account of my innocency. Yet, they did
                not question nor believe any of those slanders but, when
                 they perceived how I had been used, was very much troubled
                 for my sufferings, endeavouring to comfort my spirit so 
                 disconsolate. I will, therefore, humbly acknowledge the 
                 goodness and assistance of God in my supports of my good 
                 friends when I was in deep distress through the mischievousness of a <span class="quote">false tongue</span>. Many innocent has lost their lives
                 and I am sure this had well-nigh taken mine, taken with all
                 its circumstances: lying under the scourge of secret malice
                 without the least provocation or desert; then, to have my
                 friend to turn an unjust enemy, through whose 
                 treacherous compliance I was the deeplier wounded (when
                 she knew all my life and that my endeavours was for the

            establishment of this poor family in truth and holiness)
                 and that even then, when all was hatched against me, with what
                 sorrow and affliction I lived in (upon the griefs for my dear
                 husband's weakness and the troubles of his estate). God knows,
                 <span class="quote"> but I leave her to the just judge and commit my cause to
                     his holy determination</span> <span class="quote">before whose tribunal we must

                 my youth and whose mercy has never left me, never since
                 I was born, but he has kept me from the strivings of the
                 ungodly. I may say, as Hannah did, <span class="quote">talk no more so exceeding proudly ; let not arrogance proceed out of your
                 mouth: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him
                 actions are weighed</span>.
            Well might this good woman say so, <span class="quote">which was wronged
                 in the opinion of Eli and accused to be drunk</span>. But she
                 said, <span class="quote">no, my Lord, think not thy servant a daughter of
                 Belial: I am a woman of sorrowful spirit</span>.
            And even thus was I, a poor, helpless creature: having
                 great burdens and temporal afflictions on me, wrongfully abused
                 for the discharge of my duty (as a faithful wife, a mother
                 and mistress in my house) <span class="quote">as this Hannah which prayed for a
                 son</span>. And as the Lord did free this woman from the suspicion
                 of that sin, so I hope he will do for me, which has never done
                 no more either positively, or intentionally, to deserve these
                 slanders; my soul being employed and desires more for the
                 things of another life than this, and how to meet my dearest
                 saviour with a pure and holy heart.

            Such was my dear aunt's care and charitable affection towards 
                me, seeing me in such a deplorable  condition of weakness

                 I did not take any comfort in my life. And that I could not
                 sleep but still the frights and terror seized upon me, as if
                 those two persons, which so abused me, were standing ready to tear
                 my eyes and, as I fancied in my dreams, would have killed me.

            how to preserve my life, which was brought into a second hazard
                 by Mrs Danby's repetitions of her maid's slanders to my aunt
                 Norton: endeavouring by that to clear her own unworthiness towards me and base abuse of Mr Comber; causing my maid, Hannah,
                 to be arraigned before my aunt and herself to avouch the old lies
                and new ones freshly invented. But Hannah was still so far
                 from acknowledging them that she did attest the falsehood of
                 them all with great indignity, and told her she did endeavour
                 to make her guilty of those lies and abominable slanders that 
                 she vowed before the Lord she was innocent of; that she might
                 make her guilty of her mistress's murder and damn her own
                 soul; and that she would vindicate me to her death, being the best
                 and chastest woman in the world and could not prevail with all
                 her threats against her. When my aunt perceived her malice,
                 she told her that she did not deserve what I had done for her in
                all things which she had heard from herself. And although she, herself, did witness me to be wronged, it was a sign she would
                 fain have some occasion against me were it never so unjust.</span>
            
            
    <span class="event" id="ev208h-start"> 
            And afterwards, upon her telling her that my husband desired
                 she should prepare herself to go from hence, and that I would
                 procure her a coach if she pleased to go any whither amongst
                her friends. Upon which, she said, I promised to keep her, and she
                 would not go out of this house. But my aunt told her, if
                 I did so, the more unworthy wretch was she that had so abused
                 me, and to this purpose, the innocentest and faithful friend she had.
                 At length, my good aunt so ordered the business that she named
                 a day for her going, and there was a coach procured from Madam
                 Graham, my noble friend, which carried her to York with two
                servants to wait on her, being on Friday the 11th of September 1668.
            At her departure, I gave her to supply her necessities £3 more
                 to the former £5 sent to her: she having had out of my purse
                 that year about £20 in all, with charges about her journeys, and
                all supplies of linen and other necessaries.
            
            I was exceeding weak in bed when she went, nor did I hope to
                 recover either health or strength again had it not been out of the
                 infinite riches and goodness of my gracious God, which wrought
                miracles on me, his faithful, innocent handmaid:

            in giving me the praises and tears, comforts and assistances of
                 my dear husband and aunt, with my good brother Denton and all
                 other of my faithful friends, who could not be but convinced
                 of those horrible wickedness's in these passages related, and
                 all endeavoured my restoration again that my life might
                 be spared to give glory to the <span class="evquote">God of my salvation</span>.
           
            One passage more must not be forgotten, which my brother Denton
                and aunt was witness of: that Mrs Danby, believing (as she
                 said) me and Mr Comber to be wronged, did solemnly swear
                 to them that she would never open her mouth against us
                 of anything while she breathed. And since she went away
                 has endeavoured to be reconciled to me again that she might
                enjoy the same privileges as before.</span>
            
            
            But surely neither God's law nor man's can oblige me
                 to entertain those parties, which has so highly sinned against both : for those wounds are incurable which she gave
                 and will not leave me to my grave. Let no good Christian
                 tax my charity: the sins were of such a nature against my
                honour and family's that it would confirm those lies which has been
                 against me and a great dishonour of God and Christian religion. And, therefore, not of that private concern (within the verge of
                 my private charity) as of a petty, particular injury.
            Nor would I, for the world, patronise anything of this nature
                 who has so clear a conscience towards God and man,
                 nor open the mouths of the wicked justly against the person of
                 those of whom I know no evil.
            In this I will not fail, that my prayers may be heard for her
                 true and unfeigned repentance; that God may pardon those
                 great and high indignities against himself, the truth and us,

            It pleased God to give my sweet Robin Thornton a very
                 great deliverance upon the 25th of July. In his play, with
                 his sister, Kate, and cousin, Willy Denton, standing in the window in the hay lathe at Newton, which is above four yards from
                 the earth, he fell down into the lane near a great stone
                 which, if he had light on, might have killed him (falling so
                 high, so that the danger was very great). And his deliverance also,
                 and ought to be had in remembrance with gratitude and
                 hearty thanks to the God of heaven, which sent his angel to
                 preserve my poor child from death or any harm, save
                 a lump on his face.</span>
            The glorious name of Jehovah be praised and magnified
                 for his life and the preservations thereof from all casualties,
               dangers, sicknesses, dislocations and evils, and giving
                 him a competent share of understanding, wit, memory,
                 a loving and affable nature, with several other good gifts
                 tending to the accomplishment of his person with natural endowments. But I do adore the Lord's name and mercy which
                 <span class="quote">hath begun some dawning hopes of his grace in his heart</span>;
                 appearing in his being affected with good instructions in the
                 knowledge and fear of God, and his desire to be informed of all
                things concerning God, with notions of fear in hearing his
                judgements, with several pathetical expressions of God and
                 his ways. One day, being about four years old, he told me
                 of his own accord that God was a pure, holy, wise
                 and merciful spirit, but the devil was a wicked, lying,
                 malicious spirit: was it not better to believe this holy,
                 good God and serve him than that wicked, evil spirit which
                 would destroy us? I must, therefore, with humble gratitude
                 take notice with comfort in his mercy, which did not despise the
                 prayers of his handmaid but given me a gracious answer
                 to my humble supplications when I wanted a son. <span class="quote">For this
                 blessing, I begged of the Lord, as Hannah did Samuel, and
                 has dedicated him to his service even all his days</span>; further
                 craving the continuance of his favour and grace of his spirit
                 upon my son, endowing his 
        [heart]

                 Christian virtues (faith, knowledge, wisdom and true understanding ) to guide and direct

            him in his youth to his riper age to follow him and walk
                 in his ways with a perfect heart even to his lives end.
            Preserve him from the sins and vanities, follies, evil inclinations
                 (either of custom, examples or natural habits) which might
                 stain or pollute his soul in thy sight, and from all temporal
                 evils so far as shall seem fit in thy wisdom to give him.
                 And, finally, I beseech thee, preserve him from eternal 
                 sorrow and misery in the world to come. Thus, consigning
                 this, my child, as a blessing to his family, comfort to his
                 weak mother and relations, and an instrument of the glory
                 of thee (his Creator) in this life, serving thee faithfully in
                 this generation in righteousness and, at the last, may joyfully praise thee in heaven. All which I most humbly and
                heartily beg for the lone sake of our dearest Lord and saviour,

                 Malton (when I was so weak that I kept my bed a week
                 before and since her going away). So, about the 14th day of
                 September (they going away upon the 11th) I got up, beginning to
                 rejoice at my deliverance (from the late weakness and illness both of the plague of slanderous tongues) and the

                 falling sick at Malton brought to me in a letter to my

                 day and night posting thither to let me know how he did.
            Nor could I possibly, without the loss of my life, be carried
                 to see him, albeit they could not keep me from him until I
                 was brought so feeble by reason of another accident
                 that befell me in my grief. Then was the grandest affliction
                 upon my heart that could be, under which I had surely 
                 fainted (as it was my desire, rather than to have lost
                 my joy and comfort) had not the almighty power and mercy of God miraculously upheld my spirit from sinking.
            
            
    
            On Wednesday, I sent my brother Denton and Mr Comber
                 to my dear joy at Malton, longing all that day to hear
                 from him, still earnestly desiring to have gone myself
                 but my friends would not let me for fear of my

            poor and miserable life, which yet I despised in comparison
                 of him. So, with much impatience, great fears and some hope,
                 I waited until night, when  word was brought
                 me from Dr Wittie
                 that I should <span class="evquote">be of good cheer and not cast away my life</span>,
                 for I should have my dear husband home as well as ever
                 I had him in my life.
            So that I endeavoured to comfort up my hopes in God, the
                 Almighty, whose power was infinite as his mercy and 
                 sweetest clemency to us his poor servants, had been often
                 showed. And poured out my prayers and tears abundantly that night for the preservation of the life and health of my
                 dear husband with me; if it were the good will and pleasure of our God that the dear and sweet union and affection
                 entire in our lives together might not be broke, nor we 
                 separated by death from the enjoyment of each other in him;
                 if this might stand with the gracious pleasure of our gracious
                 God, I made these, the requests of my soul, to him.
            That night was spent in some little slumbers, but very
                 unquiet and full of fears, tremblings and sad apprehensions.
            
                 In the morning, my brother Denton came home and very
                 discreetly prepared me, with good advice and counsel, to
                 entertain the Lord's determinate will in all things with 
                 patience and submission, if the worst should fall upon me
                according to my fears. But withal, said that God could raise
                 my dearest joy up again were he never so weak (as I
                 had experience of) if he see it fit for us; although, indeed,
                 my dear heart was then very weak. At which words, my
                 faintings renewed with my exceeding sorrows for the fears of
                 being deprived of this, my sole delight in this world, next
                 under God. The Lord pardon my impatience in this concern,
                 which had, for the three last past years, been weaning him and myself
                from this world through great and manifold tribulations.
            
            
    
                Thus, betwixt hopes and fears, I remained until the next messenger came at four o'clock on Thursday in the afternoon, at which
                 time I received the sad news (for me) of my most terrible
                 loss that any poor woman could have; in being deprived of my
                 sweet and exceeding dear husband's life.</span>

      <p id="div-120">     
           Such was the violency of prevailing passion and affliction
                 upon this change that I was almost changed with him
                 and ready to go into the grave; that, as we had lived in holy
                 marriage almost 17 years, so I might be his faithful
                 spouse in life and death. Great was my sorrow and extremity which had endured many <span class="quote">sharp arrows</span> from the
                 Lord, but this exceeded the rest of all temporal losses, crosses
                 and sorrows that ever befell me. Now, being under a fresh
                 gale of storms and tempests, bereaved of my head and
                     husband, my guide and support in this life, left to be tossed
                 with the waves of sorrows and billows of sadness and discontent that usually attends the distressed estate of a disconsolate widow.
            Oh, the Lord has broken in upon me like a mighty water
                 and poured upon me his indignation. Great are my calamities and temporal troubles: <span class="quote">my cup is full with most
                 sad complaints</span> may I bewail, being bereft of a most
                 dear and tender, virtuous and loving husband, which took
                 part with me all in my sorrows and sufferings, comforted me
                  in sadnesses. We walked together in dear love and union:
                his love was mine, and I was his, in sickness and health, et cetera. In his
                sufferings,  I was afflicted: how can it be that I can subsist
                 after his loss? <span class="quote">Oh, my eyes run down with tears night and
                 day for the loss of this my earthly delight</span>. He, being gone to
                  our heavenly Father, has left me to lament his loss
                 from me and his poor, fatherless children: weak in body,
                 afflicted in spirit, low in estate, losses in my dearest
                 friends and relations and children, with the departure of other
                 comforts as dear as my life itself. And now, to consummate
                 my full measure, my dearest joy here, is withdrawn.
            Oh, that my sorrows were weighed and that the Lord would
                 pity my distress. I am still thy creature, O Lord, by creation,
                 redemption, preservation, sanctification and supportation
                 from the jaws of hell and the grave.
            <span class="quote">Do not despise thy handiwork</span>; <span class="quote">for thou didst make me</span>,
                 <span class="quote">I am thine</span>. Oh, give me understanding <span class="quote">to hear thy heavy

            rod and who that sent it</span>. Let it be thy pleasure, since thou 
                 still givest me life, that it may be for a blessing, <span class="quote">giving me
                 understanding to serve thee with a perfect heart and willing
                 mind</span> <span class="quote">to hear the rod and who hath sent it</span>. <span class="quote">Is there any evil
                 in a city and the Lord has not done it</span>? <span class="quote">Is there not an appointed
                 time for man once to die</span>? <span class="quote">Oh, that I may daily die to sin and live
                 in righteousness</span> with God in soul and spirit, loving him with 
                all my soul. <span class="quote">I must be still and know that it is God</span> that ruleth 
                in heaven and earth. <span class="quote">The Lord is his name</span>, and his mercy 
                 is showed unto us; yea, even in this, his visitation. Therefore , <span class="quote">will I lay my mouth in the dust</span> with humble submission,
                 considering that whatever he doth is good.
            Had he not in much mercy drawn my dear joy to himself and fitted him for this dissolution: <span class="quote">he remembering the Lord
                 in the days of his youth</span>, and God, I hope, was found of him?
                 What although I now do want those good and pious prayers,
                 which he put up for me and mine, many years enjoyed from him
                 the benefit of? <span class="quote">Yet I will trust wholly upon the sole mediation and
                 intercession of our blessed Christ</span>, who ever lives to make intercession for his widow and orphans. And yet, such is my
                 frailty (if a deep affection be termed so) that I can say 
                 nothing but puts a fresh remembrance and brings a <span class="quote">new flood of
                 tears which I water my couch withal</span>, and widowed, disconsolate
                bed for myself and children. And yet,  my think,  I hear
                 him say, <span class="quote">as our saviour to the women that wept after him,
                 'weep not for me  (that am now in joy and bliss) but weep for
                 yourself and little ones</span>. I was in the world tormented with 
                 pains, crosses, losses, sickness, troubles on every side. But
                 now, I am comforted <span class="quote">in the bosom of my Father and thy Father</span>
                 which I longed after, and so shalt thou in his good time.
                 Is there not, then, no means to assuage thy immoderate grief
                for this sad separation? Oh yes, there is hope in the later end'.
                 What although my poor 
        [heart]
    , thou art deprived of his presence,
                <span class="quote"> doest thou not believe in God that those shall be blessed that believe
                 in him</span>? And, by the merits of his redeemer, he now enjoys the
                 incomprehensible joys of the great God of heaven, <span class="quote">where all
                 tears is wiped off from his eyes, all sorrows is departed from
                     him</span>, <span class="quote">and he is delivered from this body of death</span>?
            O, my soul, let his happiness mitigate thy sorrows in his loss:
            

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.268&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 268</a>



            
                 
            
            considering that what he now enjoys, he would not exchange
                 for ten thousand worlds, and thy present loss is his eternal
                 advantage. As St Paul saith, <span class="quote">for me to live is Christ but
                 to die is gain</span>. Oh, desire to be made happy with him in <span class="quote">the 
                 resurrection, when we shall appear together and be clothed
                 with immortality</span>, enjoying the fruition of that Godhead,
                 as David says, <span class="quote">in thy presence is fullness of joy and pleasure
                     at thy right hand for evermore</span>.
            And I may say with Job, <span class="quote">although worms consume this
                 body, yet with my eyes shall I see God</span>, and beholding him
                <span class="quote">face to face</span>, which this clayey body of dust cannot enjoy in
                this vale of flesh, until this vile body be changed and made 
                like his, and <span class="quote">this mortal put on immortality</span>.
            Oh, that the Lord would now give me faith, and show himself to
                 his weak handmaid and servant, making me to believe
                 what good things is laid up for them that love and fear him.
                And though great are the troubles of the righteous here yet
                 are they but in order to consign them to a better kingdom,
                 and <span class="quote">he will deliver them out of all</span>. Oh, do not then
                 repine or call in question the mercy and goodness of this
                 great, wise, holy and gracious Father, for if thou belongest to
                 him, he will give thee to know his mind. <span class="quote">It is the Lord: he
                 must do what he will</span>.
            Although this dispensation is most bitter, as the cutting of
                 thy life, be silent, and do not sin against him by impatience
                 or resisting his pleasure. <span class="quote">Has not the heavenly potter power over our earthly clay to do what seemest him best</span>? 
           
                 What if flesh and blood cannot part so willingly. Remember,
                 <span class="quote">thou must live by faith</span> and say, unfeignedly, <span class="quote">thy will be done</span>
                 in all things, if ever thou expect salvation hereafter.
                 He was prepared for death; thou art not, perhaps he has 
                 some other work for thee to do in this troublesome world? Pray
                 that thou might be assisted to perform his pleasure and
                 keep thee in a continual preparedness. And that, as we did
                 help in this life to <span class="quote">bear one another burdens</span>, <span class="quote">so may we
                 together reign with Christ in glory</span>, who is <span class="quote">the author and finisher
                 of our faith</span>, daily panting and breathing after him to be

            <span class="quote">clothed upon with the garment of righteousness and true
                 holiness</span> that <span class="quote">death might put on immortality</span>. Spending
                 a few days here amongst thy children in piety and holiness,
                 bringing them up in the fear and nurture of the Lord, that I may
                 deliver up my charge to the great God of heaven (of my
                 children's souls he has given me) with joy and not with grief,
                 according to that saying: <span class="quote">I, and the children thou hast given me,
                 will serve the Lord</span>.
           That so, in the end of my days, I may receive the end of my
                 hope, even the salvation of our souls. <span class="quote">Where there shall be
                 no sighing, no weeping; for all tears shall be wiped from
                 our eyes</span>, <span class="quote">to follow the lamb wheresoever he goes</span>. There, is
                 <span class="quote">love without dissimulation</span> and hatred; joy without diminution
                 or sorrow; delight and satisfaction without mixture of passion;
            the full fruition of our hopes, without disappointments; peace,
                 without anger or impatience; envy and hatred shall not enter
                 there; no cares, fears or solicitudes shall interrupt our comforts, our beatitude; and that which makes the happiness completed:
                 these enjoyments are eternal without fears of losing or
               shadow of changing. For in heaven, we must believe our saviour,
                 <span class="quote">they are as the angels</span>: nay higher, being drawn nearer to
                 God, united to divine nature in the person of the word, in that hypostatical union of our nature in Christ, <span class="quote">who took upon him
                 not the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of
                 Abraham</span>, that he might be <span class="quote">like unto his brethren, that he might
                 be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining
                 to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people</span>
               (Hebrews 2:16-17). This privilege the <span class="quote">sons of men</span> have by the
                 second person of the blessed Trinity, even the eternal son
                 of God, blessed forever. Shall we prefer dross above
                 gold, and the fading pleasures of this pitiful life before eternity?
                
                 God forbid: let us lay aside all hindrances of this life,
                 striving to fight this battle of the Lord, <span class="quote">being armed with
                 his weapons</span> (as St Paul has taught us) against sin, the world
                 and the devil; <span class="quote">for to him that overcomes will I give freely to drink

                 Yet, it is thy divine pleasure to condescend to our weak

                 in whose
                
                    
                most holy and prevailing name and merits, I humbly address
                these weak and imperfect requests, beseeching thee, in him, to
                 accept my person and prayers, <span class="quote">purifying both by his precious
                 and all healing bloodshed upon the cross</span>.

            I humbly beseech thy majesty — as thou hast given me this
                 being in this earth and continuing the same thus long, and
                 hast prolonged my life, notwithstanding all my unworthiness
                and sins — that <span class="quote">thou wilt pardon whatever I have offended
                     in thy sight ever since I was born</span>: pity my infirmities, and
                 strengthen my weakness and human frailties; <span class="quote">heal my 
                soul</span> and love me freely; make me to understand thy word 
                 and know thee to be a God hearing prayer; and wilt <span class="quote">dwell in the
                 heart of those that are holy and humble, of a contrite heart</span> and 
                 trembles at thy word, thy power and attributes. Give me 
                 grace to glorify thy name and submit cheerfully to this 
                 heavy dispensation to thy handmaid; serving thee, not 
                 with a slavish fear, but out of a true obediential and 
                 filial duty, love and affection; <span class="quote">knowing that thou dost not 
                afflict willingly</span> but, even in this separation, did it (I hope)
                for the happiness of my husband by freeing him from troubles,
                 and that thou wilt thereby draw me nearer to  thyself
                 by setting my affections more on heaven above and not on earth.
                 I will also give thee the glory and praise which hast kept me from
                 presumptuous sins, giving me a tender heart (I hope) for the 
                 least offence against thee that may endanger a separation
                 betwixt my soul and God. O Lord, take me now to thy own
                 more immediate keeping and tuition, who hast now taken my
                head, whom thou gavest to be a comfort and a guide and for whom
                 I bless thy name that I enjoyed him so long. And let me not
                 sin in resisting thy pleasure or disputing thy providence, who
                 canst do all things. I pray thee now, O Lord, bless thy
                 servant in this desolate condition, whom thou hast let to
                 see thy various trials and afflictions, and hast bestowed so 
                 much pains upon. <span class="quote">Here I am</span>: <span class="quote">Lord, what wilt thou have me
                 to do</span>? <span class="quote">I resign my will to thy glorious pleasure</span> either in
                 life or death: make me be <span class="quote">free from this body of sin and death</span>
                 to serve thee with perfect freedom of mind, will and affections
                 that I may be holy in soul, body and spirit. Though I be sick,
                 let me be sound in thee. <span class="quote">Teach me thy laws and I shall live</span>.

            Oh, let my widowed condition be a sanctified estate.
                 <span class="quote">Yea, even thou writing upon my heart</span>, <span class="quote">holiness unto the Lord</span>,
                 that I may be exemplary in my life and conversation to
                 thy glory and praise. My children may be great instruments
                 of thy praise also, <span class="quote">chosen vessels</span> in <span class="quote">this crooked generation</span>.
                 Although my afflictions be heavy and burdensome to this
                 weak body, yet I acknowledge them just, as coming from
                thee; <span class="quote">my strength, my hope, my joy and fortress</span> who dost
                 withal <span class="quote">make a way for me to escape</span>.
            Lord, be to thy servant as thou wast unto David, who served
                 thee with a ready mind: <span class="quote">thou art the giver,
                 the gift is
                 thyself</span>. <span class="quote">Oh, let thy spirit dwell in me</span> and mine richly. <span class="quote">Let
                 my latter days be still a separate condition from evil
                (the evil of sin and the evil of punishment) as much as thou seest fit</span>.
                 I beseech thee, preserve me and my family from dishonourable
                 walking, <span class="quote">leading us in thy ways and directing us in our 
                steps</span>. <span class="quote">Make me to walk as an example before them in grace,
                patience, holiness, humbleness, chastity, piety, faith and purity,
                 meekness and charity</span>, with a supply of all other Christian
                 virtues and graces necessary to lead my life here and to
                 make me acceptable in thy sight and follow my dear saviour
                 in this pilgrimage towards that <span class="quote">heavenly Jerusalem</span> where
                I may forever glorify thy majesty for all, to all eternity.
            All these <span class="quote">humble requests and petitions I crave for the only

            My dear husband went to Malton to my sister 
                 Portington's on Friday the 11th of September 1668, being
                 in health much as of late, pretty well of his infirmity.
                He rid into that fair upon Saturday to church on Sunday.
            </span><a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.273&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 273</a><span class="event" id="ev211a-start">   
                Upon Monday, he was not well and had pills given him 
                (as he used to have) by my brother Portington, but they did
                not work kindly and so had a clyster given him, being the
                 method ordered by Dr Wittie.</span><span class="event" id="ev212-start">
            On Monday, he sent for Mr Sinclair and told him that
                 he knew formerly he had been in much trouble and sadness
                for his sins and walked uncomfortably for the want of the
                sense of God's favour in great fears and doubtings.
                But now, the Lord was pleased to make himself known 
                 to him <span class="evquote">to be a reconciled Father in Christ Jesus</span>, and that
                he was at peace with him; he, perceiving a great deal of
                 joy and comfort inwardly in his soul and mind. Blessing
                the Lord for this, his infinite mercies, and hoped that he should
                bless his name forever more that he  had been so troubled,
                 for now he was reconciled to him again. These, with many
                 such like expressions, to the great satisfaction of Mr Sinclair
                 who stayed a good while with him.</span><span class="event" id="ev212a-start">
            Then, towards night, this sweet saint of God grew worse,
                and more heavy and drowsy, according to that distemper, and
                they sent to me for the doctor which came to him on Wednesday, after
                dinner. My dear was then very weak in body but, I
                bless God, perfect in mind and understanding. Mr Comber 
                going to see him, he took his leave of him and bid him to 
                 remember him to his dear wife: bid me be patient and
                contented with God's hand, and to submit to his will, which he uttered
                 as well as he could for his speech being taken. After which he
                had his hair taken off by order (being the last remedy) and this
                with his own consent. But alas, no remedies or medicine
                 nor art could prevail: it being the determination of our God
                to take him to himself.</span><span class="event" id="ev213-start">And yet, to mix this <span class="evquote">bitter cup of
                 death</span> with the allay of a quiet frame and temper, free from
                any torment or signs of pains, lying as if he were in a sweet
                sleep. And by degrees, growing colder at his feet and so,
                dying upwards, and drawing his breath shorter all the Thursday
                 morning 
                and towards eleven o'clock in the forenoon, he
                 fetched one little sigh and so sweetly resigned up his spirit
                in to the hands of his dear saviour and redeemer, Jesus Christ.

                He departed on Thursday the 17th of September 1668,
                betwixt the hours of 11 and 12 at noon; he being, on the 2nd
                    day of June (1668), 44 years of age; we, having lived a dear and loving couple in holy marriage almost
                 17 years.

            My dear husband's body was brought home to East
                Newton on Friday the 18th of September, in company of many of
                our neighbours, gentry and other friends those that were about
                 us. And I did desire that his interment might be deferred
                 until we could acquaint our remote friends and relations. But
                 the doctor told them that he had laid not long sick and taking
                 of physic would hinder that. Those that were helpers to bear
                 his corpse were of his kindred and relations:
             my brother, Thomas Thornton; my brother Denton;
                my brother Portington; my cousin, William Ayscough;
                my cousin, Ralph Crathorne; my cousin, John Crathorne;
                my cousin Bullock; my cousin, Edward Lascelles.
            There was a very great congregation at that time. He being, 
                 most generally beloved of his country, a man of great
                 piety, peace, honesty. There was a great lamentation
                for him, God having given him much love and affection.
            But my sorrows and laments cannot be weighed for him, which
                 parted with the great and sole delight and comfort I esteemed of my
                 life. The Lord grant me some measure of patience to sustain
                that I may not displease the great governor of heaven and earth,
                 but <span class="evquote">desire to submit for the Lord's sake with resignation to his will</span>
                 and in hopes of a joyful resurrection, at the last day, then to
                 be united in hallelujahs to the God most high forever.
                 My dearest heart was interred in his own alley at Stonegrave
                     church near his mother and two sweet babes, Christopher
                and Joyce. Buried on Friday the 18th of September, between four
                 and five o'clock, by Mr Thomas Comber, who preached his
                funeral sermon. The text was in Ecclesiastes 12:1,
                <span class="evquote">Remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth</span>, et cetera,
                 applying it fitly to that occasion. </span>
            
             
               
                Lord, he loves thee the less that loves anything with
                 thee, which he loves not for thee (St Augustine).

            O Lord, our God, the God of our salvation, who for our
                 sakes were wounded and didest die to redeem
                 our souls from hell, and wast pleased to lie in the
                 grave that our sins might be buried by thee
                by an act of oblivion. But thou alone, of all that ever died,
                 were free amongst the dead to show thy sovereignty
                 and power over all, and of thy own power didst arise
                 again with victory and triumph over hell and the grave.
                 O powerful, almighty and omnipotent Jehovah, look
                 down from thy throne of majesty and mercy with a 
                 gracious eye of favour and compassion, and behold
                 me, the unworthiest of thy creatures, making my addresses at thy <span class="quote">throne of grace</span>. O Holy Trinity, I humbly
                 beseech thee, <span class="quote">regard the pourings out of a weak, frail,
                 despised handmaid of thine</span>; yet whose heart is truly

                 <span class="quote">Have mercy upon thy servant, whom thou has made

                 vexed me with all thy storms</span>; <span class="quote">thy hand presseth me
                 sore</span>; <span class="quote">my Soul is full of troubles</span> and heaviness by reason
                 of my sins, and <span class="quote">my life draweth nigh unto the grave</span>;
             my body in distress; my soul under sadder calamities
                 by the withdrawings of thy presence. <span class="quote">Hide not thou, thy

                 seek thee with greater ardour and zeal. Oh, pardon thy
                 servant's frailties and infirmities in too much sorrow and 
                grieving for the being deprived of my head and husband, and
                 let me acknowledge thy hand with submissiveness and patience.
                 It is thou, Lord, that art gracious and good to the <span class="quote">children of men</span>.
                 Oh, restore me to thy favour again to comfort me in my
                 sorrows and sadnesses, and now I am brought into a forlorn
                 and widowed condition, O Lord, I beseech thee give me

            Make me thankful for so long enjoyment, as also
                for those eminent gifts and graces, which thou in mercy had
                endowed him with. To thee be the honour given, due unto thy
                 name and, O Lord, give me the power of thy grace and strength
                 to imitate his virtues, which was called to thy service in
                 our youths, and from our youths, by thy miraculous providence preserved from those enormities which hundreds commit
                 to their own perdition. Oh, give me therefore now thy

                thy good pleasure to continue me yet a while longer,
                 to do thee service here, give me my <span class="quote">life for a prey</span>, and keep

            but by thy goodness and bounty I am yet remaining.
            Oh, let me beg it of thy majesty, without offence, that I
                might be in a more prepared condition to meet thee,
                the <span class="quote">sweet bridegroom of my soul</span>, being found doing
                <span class="quote">the work of my Lord</span>. And, in the interim, <span class="quote">let me show forth
                 the loving kindness of the Lord</span> <span class="quote">amongst the redeemed ones</span>
                <span class="quote">in the land of the living</span>: <span class="quote">for the living, the living, he shall

                but give me sufficient sustentation and support to enable
                with fortitude <span class="quote">to endure thy fatherly chastisements</span> that
                 thou mayst have the glory of all, and my soul reap the benefit of thy rod by amendment of life in better obedience.
                I humbly beseech thee, O Lord, my God, to give me also a
                 healthy temper of body, to be the better enabled to do my
                 duty which thou hast called me unto as a faithful and 
                careful mother, and head of this family; praying thee to
                continue it still, if it be thy pleasure, for many generations
                 to glorify thy name on earth, and made members of thy
                 mystical body in heaven of thy Church Triumphant.
            Dear Lord, I pray thee, bless
                    
             my three children with all
                 blessings in order to eternity, with grace, wisdom and understanding. <span class="quote">Be thou their portions and inheritance</span> forever:
                <span class="quote">for whom thou blessest, they shall be blessed</span>. Oh, sanctify them
                 with thy spirit from their youth and preserve them by thy
                 power from vicious humours and corrupt inclination of the
                Old Adam. But, <span class="quote">putting on the Lord Jesus Christ</span>, neither let them
                 want anything in this life without the which they cannot
                 serve thee, nor let them be rebellious or disobedient to
                 their spiritual, politic or natural parents. Make
                them obedient to thy laws and precepts, divine and moral,
                and teach thou me, by thy spirit, that I may instruct them
                in those duties thou hast commanded; that so, I may be 
                assisted to discharge a good conscience in all holy precepts.
                Give them also, I beseech thee, an <span class="quote">obedient ear</span> and <span class="quote">a
                 willing heart</span>, in love and affection, and submit to those
                 instructions from thee that they may be comforts to thy
                 servant in this her disconsolate condition.

            Grant that each year they may grow up in grace and the
                 knowledge of our Lord, and that thou mayst be glorified in and
                 by them. I beseech thee, let none of them be <span class="quote">children of
                 perdition</span>, but let their souls be precious in their
                 sight, forever more.
            Endow me, thy handmaid, with suitable qualifications
                 to serve thee in their godly and religious educations,
                and to serve thee, <span class="quote">the searcher of hearts</span>, with zeal and a
                constant, regular devotion. Restore and preserve us in the
                 life of righteousness, sobriety and humility and chastity
                 in our words and actions. Blessing me and mine with happy
                opportunities of religion all our days, and doing thee
                faithful service that we are capable of in this life.
            <span class="quote">That I may redeem the time past</span> and by thy grace, may
                <span class="quote">grow rich in good works</span>, <span class="quote">always abounding in the work

                 to be rendered up into thy hands, my soul may not
                 be abhorred of thee nor suffer thy terrors but may
                 feel an eternity of blessings in <span class="quote">the resurrection of the
                just</span>. And further my humble request is, O Father, that 
                 <span class="quote">thou wilt shed thy spirit of grace</span> into the hearts of
                 all my children and myself that we may be firmly united to thee and each other in the bands of faith and charity.
            That it may not be in Satan's power, nor his instruments,
                 to disunite our hearts from thee and each other, but that we
                 may continue forever in truth, unity and peace and
                 concord <span class="quote">that the God of peace may give us his peace through
                 his Holy Spirit of sanctification</span>. And all these most

                 pardon for my errors in these prayers and imperfect
                 requests, and heartily craving them at thy most

                 both for our souls and bodies; even for our <span class="quote">Lord Jesus
                Christ's his sake</span>, <span class="quote">the righteous</span>, to whom, with the

A glorious tabernacle's sharedWherein no sun needs shine, for he aloneIs all the light in that vast horizon.What then, if through a sea of briny tearsThou swimmest? He'll free thee from all fearsOf sinking; canst thou but hold him fast,In arms of faith, thou shalt come safe at last.Nay, wert thou dead, yet shalt thou live A life much more superlativeThan heart can think, or tongue can tell;Those glories all, they doth excel.He strive 'til death but shall my feeble strifeBe crowned?

      <p id="div-128" class="poetry">Since nature's works be good, and death doth serveAs nature's work, why should we fear to die?Since fear is vain, but when it may preserve,Why should we fear that which we cannot fly?Fear is more pain than is the pain it fears,Disarming human minds of native might:While each conceit an ugly figure bears,Which were not evil, well viewed in reason's light.Our only eyes, which dimmed with passions be,And scarce discern the dawn of coming day, Let them be cleared, and now begin to see:Our life is but a step in dusty way.Then, let us hold the bliss of gracious mind,Since this we feel, great loss we cannot find.</p>

And could I,With Indian angels, and a speaking eye,Command bare heads, bowed knees, strike justice dumb,

                My father and mother living at Kirklington,
                where I was born and my brother Christopher also,
                 the same maidservant attended upon him and was
                 his dry nurse (Sarah Tomlinson) which kept me after I
                was weaned; being likewise both nursed by one
                wet nurse, though upon having a fresh milk (she had 
                a child betwixt the nursing my brother and myself)
                and, having been very good and careful of the first child,
                 my parents saw it fit she should nurse the second child too;
                discharging the duty so well to me,</span> I heard it observed, that 
                 I was both a strong and healthful child all along, never
                having had either the rickets or any other disease;
                 for which I most humbly and heartily give thanks to the
                 <span class="quote">God of my salvation</span>, which still had his gracious eye
                 of providence over me both at my birth, when my
                 dear mother brought me forth in great peril of her
              life (she being weak upon the birth of all her children,
                having had seven in all: four sons and three daughters).
                Yet the Lord gave me a sound, healthful body, straight
                limbs and of a reasonable understanding: praised be his
                 glorious name forever.
            Yet has his goodness been more extended to me in this
                 and all other preservations that I might not forget his
                 mercies forever. And that hath many ways of the extent 
                 of his favours to young infants in their deliverances
                from death and destruction in this world, besides that of sicknesses and weakness of body; for if his divine providence did
                not send his angels to keep and guard little children, they
                 could not continue nor be preserved from all evil accidents

            and casualties incident to that feeble and weak
                 estate of infants and childhoods.
          For, although their innocency be not capable of offending
                 others, yet that innocency and harmlessness is not able to
                 defend them from injurious dealings from evil
                 persons, neglects, and brutishness of nurses and carelessness of others; not to mention those infinite hazards
              of overlaying and badness of their food and evil milk
              (added to the dreadful malice of Satan, who doth
                 by all means endeavour to destroy mankind,
                 sets on work all his engines against us by more
              designs than we can see or be capable to understand).
              Therefore, am I forever bound to bless the eternal
              name of God, who hath sent his guardian 
              
                 angel to watch over me and mine for my good and
                 preservation ever since I was born. <span class="quote">The number
              of his miraculous deliverances are past finding out</span>,
                 yet will I call to mind what I can that he might receive
                 the glory of all. <span class="event" id="ev216-start">There was now a most great
              preservation to me, when I was but a little child and
              was following my maid, Sarah  Tomlinson,
              who carried my brother, Christopher, in her arms.
              And I took hold of her coat, my weak hand (being
              but about three years old) could not go so fast after her,
                 but  stumbled against the threshold and
              fell upon the corner stone of the hearth (in the
              chamber called the passage chamber which leads to
              my dear mother's chamber). At which time, I
                 broke the skull of my forehead (in the very top)
              against the said roll so grievously (about an inch
              long) insomuch that the skin of the brain was
                 seen and in great danger of death being like to
              have bleed to death (it being so desperate a
              wound). But by the providence of God, and my dear
              mother's skill and care of me, she did make a
              perfect cure (only a great scar still remains and will
                 never be gone</span> to put me in fresh mind of my great

            How hath my forgetful soul let this mercy 
                 slip out of mind and not remembered to give the Lord his
                praises due to his name? But now, O my soul, return
                 thy solemn thanks and praises to this great and gracious
                God, who hath had mercy and compassion both on thee
                when thou wast a poor, weak infant and brought
                 thee to these years through infinite more dangers.
                <span class="quote">To the Lord, my God, therefore, do I pour out my soul</span>
                 in humble gratitude for this great preservation in the
                beginning of my days; beseeching him to accept of me now,
                 his handmaid, both to serve him and praise him forever.
                 And with all my might do I sing praises to his glorious
                 name, who hath had the same pity, and compassion both
                as a tender and dear parent and guardian. Oh, let thy
                 providence still go along with me all my days, and
                 that thy angel guardians may defend me with thy
                 shield to preserve me from precipice or falls, or dislocation
                incident to this life, who now grows in my later age
                even almost a child in strength. <span class="quote">Leave me not
                nor forsake me</span>, who has none to depend on but thee, the

                 since I was born. Bring me into that state of innocency
                of soul, by a conversion truly into the state of grace,
                 that I may freely bear thy trials and believe thy promise
                that, through them, I may at the last be conducted into
                the land of eternal rest, there to sing and praise thy
                holy, glorious name and Holy Trinity forever and ever.

            As my dear mother,  my honoured father,  myself and
                brothers (George, Christopher, and John) was going in the
                coach to see Kildare after my father bought it, there
                 was a narrow place we were to pass by a riverside.

                been saved, any of us, but all in the coach and horse
                had been utterly lost and perished in that deep river).
                My father did ride on horseback, but by reason
                of the narrow way could not make any assistance,
                 nor his men to help us in that danger, but was
                 much affrighted at that sudden accident.

                 the ladies using the custom to swing by the arms
                for recreation, and being good to exercise the body

                 well by the arms as they did and had never got no hurt

             But at this time, very unfortunately, some of the
                 young ladies bid one of the pages called Don de Lan

                 soon from him and deliver myself from danger before
                he had come to me.  He immediately pushed

                 swinging by my arms that I was not able to hold
                 my hands on the swing; so that he throwed me down
                  upon the chamber boards. I fell down upon 
                my face, fell to the ground and light with such a violent
                force (with all my weight on my chin bone upward)
                 that both the chin and chap bones was almost broke

                 and took away my breath insomuch as I was
                 nigh death. They thought I had been dead

                and power of my gracious God, I came to myself
                again upon the use of good means. The whole

                 but much more my dear Lady Anne that her page should
                 do so great a mischief to me.

            About three years before my noble Lord of Strafford

                 have burned it down and destroyed it to the ground
                 had it not been prevented by providence.
            There being some up in the other part of the court
                (where Sir George Radcliffe's lodging was) which saw it
                 and cried out for help (being at the dead time of
                the night, it was very terrible to behold). It began
                upon the account of a maidservant setting a 
                dust basket of charcoal embers — taken out of the
                chapel chamber, and carelessly set under the stairs
                that went up to the storehouse that night — which kindled
                 of itself, burned downstairs and that room called
                the chapel chamber above the chapel (which was most
                richly furnished with black velvet, embroidered
                with flowers of silk-work in tent-stitch, all fruit trees
                and flowers, and slips embroidered with gold twist) and
                 it burned the stately chapel built by my Lord and my 
                     Lady's lodging, with the young ladies. But, by the 
                great mercies of God, prevented their destruction and
                 was awakened by the flame appeared on the other side of the
                 court, and great help was made with speed to preserve
                my Lady and the rest which was brought out of bed in blankets.

                she could procure me to be his wife, and offered £3000 or £4000
                and Lord of Adair should come to speak for him. She said, it
                was all in vain: he must not presume to look that way
                for I was not to be obtained, and she was sure he might
                 not have any encouragement for I was resolved not to marry.
                 And put him off the best she could, but writ me private
                 word that my Lord of Adair and he would come to speak
                to me and my mother about it and willed me to get out of
                his way. It was not to further that desire in me, who did
                perfectly hate him and them all like a todd in such a kind.
            And immediately acquainted my dear mother, which was
                 surprised and troubled for she feared they would burn her
                 house and destroy all, wished me to go whither I would
                 to secure myself. and I did so forthwith run into the
                     town and hid myself privately, in great fear and a fright,
                with a good old woman of her tenants where, I bless
                God, I continued safely until the visit was over and
                 at night came home. 
            We was all joyful to escape so, for my dear mother
                was forced to give them the best treatment she could and said,
                indeed, she did not know where I was and sent out
                serve a little to seek me but I was safe from them.
            After which time, this villain captain did study
                 to be revenged of my dear mother and threatened cruelly what
                he would do to her because she hid me (though that was not
                true for I hid myself). And about the time that the Scots
                was to march into Scotland, being too long here on us,
                 when my mother paid ofter £25 and £30 a month to them.

            <a href="https://thornton.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/edition/?p0.do=book_one&amp;p0.lo=p.295&amp;p0.vi=modern" target="_blank">page 295</a>



            
                
            
            This Scot, in a boasting manner, sent for his pay and she
                sent all she ought to him, which he would not take from
                 her but demanded double money, which she would nor
                could not do. So, one Sunday morning, he brought the
                 company and threatened to break the house and doors,
                and was most vile and cruel in his oaths and swearing
                
                 against her and me; and went to drive all her goods
                in her ground, having this delicate cattle of her
                 own breed. I went up to the leader to see whether he did
                drive them away, and he looked up and, thought it had been
                my dear mother, cursed me bitterly and wished the deil blow
                 me blind and into the air. And I had been a thorn in his
                heel, but he would be a thorn in my side and drived the
                 cattle away to Richmond where General Leslie was.
            So, my dear mother was forced to take the pay he
                 was to have and carried it to the general that laid at my
                aunt Norton's, and acquainted him how that captain had
                abused her and wronged her which, by mercy of God to
                her, this General Leslie did take notice of, and took her
                 money and bid her not trouble herself for he would
                 make him take it or punish him for his rudeness.
                He said more, did Innes, that if ever any of his
                country men came into England, they would burn
                her and me and all she had. But yet, she served that God
                which did deliver us out of the Irish rebellion and all the
                bloodshed in England until this time, and did now deliver
                 her and myself and all we had from him. 
            
            
    
            This was a great deliverance at last and joined with my
                own single deliverance from this beast (from being
                 destroyed and deflowered by him) for which I have reason to praise
                 the great and mighty God of mercy to me.

            There was one of his men that I had cured of his
                 hand being cut of it and lame, so that fellow did
                me a signal return of gratitude for it. Thus,
                it was sometimes a refreshment to me (after I
                had sit up much with my dear, weak mother in
                 her illness or writing of letters for her) that she did
                bid me walk out to cows with her maid to rest
                myself, so I used this sometimes. But this captain's
                    man, who I cured, came to me one day, saying, 'dear
                mistress, I pray do not think much if I desire you, for
                God's sake, not to go out with the maids to cows'. I
                said, 'why?' He said again, he was bound to tell me
                 that his captain did curse and swear that he
                would watch for me, and that very night he had designed
                
                (with a great many of his comrades) to catch me
                at cows and force me on horseback away with them,
                and God knows what end he would make of me. I said, I
                hoped God would deliver me from all such wickedness.
                And so, I gave the man many thanks who was so
                 honest to preserve me from their plots, rewarding him for
                 his pains, and did never go abroad out of the house
                 again but forced to keep like a prisoner while they
                 was here.</span> Blessing the great God of heaven who
                 did not suffer me to fall into the hands of those
                 wicked man nor into the hand of Sir Jeremy Smithson , who could never prevail by no means to
                obtain me for his wife. And I was thus delivered also from
                 such a force by the discovery of Tom Binks.
            Lord, make me truly thankful for preservation of
                me, thy poor handmaid, and make me live to thy glory. Amen.

    <span class="event" id="ev228-start"> 
            At that time, Sir Thomas Danby was forced, with my sister
                and children to be in safety from the parliament forces
                (he, being for King Charles I) to Middleham Castle,
                a garrison under my Lord Loftus. There she was delivered
                of her first son, Francis Danby (my sister having
                 got my Lord Loftus and myself with 
                
                
                Colonel Brandling
                
                
                for witness). I was forced to go over the river near
                    Middleham, called 
                     Swale,
                 which had some stoops set up for
                 guides and if one had raised the causey they had been irrecoverably lost. At that time, I was very hearty and strong,
               and did venture to ride the same, or else might have gone
               back, and rather than she should be disappointed, did venture
               over, after my mother's servant who led the way. But it
               happened, the river proved deeper than we expected it,
               and I kept up my horse as well as I could from standing
                
                and so bore up a long time. But, when we were gone so
                far that I could not turn back, the river proved past
               riding, and the bottom could not be come to by the poor
                mare (which was an excellent mare of my poor brother
                    George Wandesford's). So, I saw myself in such apparent danger
                and begged of God to assist me and the poor beast I rid on, and to
               be merciful to me and deliver me out of that death for <span class="evquote">Jesus Christ, 
               his sake</span>, and the poor mare drew up her fore-feet and I
               perceived she did swim. I gave her the reins, and took off 
                 the short reins of the breech and gave her the head with all the
               help I could, and clasped my hands about her mane, did
                freely commit myself to my God to do what he pleased with me.
                And she did, by mercy, bear up her head and swimmed out
                above half a quarter of a mile across that dreadful river and, by
                God's great mercies, brought me over that river in safety</span> which deliverance
                was so great and dreadful that I can never forget to praise the good,

                It was no small grief and trouble to me that
                the wickedness of my eldest brother's servant 
                (by idle stories to my dear brother George
                against my poor brother Christopher) had so
                 far prevailed with him as to make a very
                great breach in their friendship, so that the younger
                 did apprehend himself much injured and
                 wronged thereby to his brother George
                
                
                 by them. And the other, though a very wise and understanding person, had been highly incensed
                 at some lies which was told of his brother to
                 him and by this means caused a very great
                 anger against each other, which proceeded to hie
                 and caused them to have such animosity as that 
                 they neither could be satisfied to receive the
                Holy Sacrament. 
           But, it pleased God to make me the happy
                 instrument to persuade and entreat each of them
                 to such moderation and charity; to ask each other
                 pardon (and God in the first place) for what had been
               amiss and to freely forgive one another, and put away
                 all former disgusts or displeasure; and to be cordially
               reconciled for his sake, who died for us. And with great
               comfort, I prevailed with them to receive this holy feast
               of love to which we were to come, and on the Easter Day, I bless
               my God, we did receive that Holy  Sacrament in zeal and devotion.
